    "\n",
    "As a new investment company which has two main trading desks - one for traditional securities and another for cryptocurrency, we are looking to automate the monitoring of reddit posts related to investing for new investing leads for both desks. Through this new leads and hot trends, we hope to filter this information to the specific trading desks. As such, we need a model to analyse and categorise the reddit posts for further review & investigation by either the securities or crypto trading desks. "

    "Reddit is home to thousands of communities, endless conversation, and authentic human connection. Whether one is into breaking news, sports, TV fan theories, or a never-ending stream of the internet's cutest animals, there's a community on Reddit for everyone. With approximately 52 million active users and 50 billion monthly views, Reddit is a platform for people of all walks of life to come together and join the communities of their interest.\n",

    "* [r/CryptoCurrency](https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/)\n",
    "\n",
    "In this subreddits & communities, we observe the engagement of authentic daily discussions. The discussions on the Investing is known to accomodate a wide range of financial discussions, from financial news, to market data, and traditonal securities. On the other hand, CryptoCurrency is a digital or virtual currency that is secured by cryptography, which makes it nearly impossible to counterfeit or double-spend. Many cryptocurrencies are decentralized networks based on blockchain technology—a distributed ledger enforced by a disparate network of computers. Hence, this makes CryptoCurrency an emerging form of investment that has been gaining traction for many individuals as well. "
