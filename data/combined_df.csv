EselSchwanz,"I'm 25 years old and just inherited a portion of the family company which sums up to about $950k, and I have a buyer at any time if I were to decide to liquidate. This started paying about $1800/month this year, which is a lot to me but less than 2.5% of the total amount. This is a crazy, game changing opportunity for me to reinvest into something that will grow my wealth as well as pay enough monthly to live off of and pursue interests/ventures even if I only make a 5% cap, but I'm really wary to do so now.

The company is currently growing and I have no idea what I'd invest in to begin with and I'm afraid of two things: 1. Never liquidating and regretting it because of the potential 2. Making bad investments and losing everything. 3. The company doubling in size and losing out on having doubled equity with no effort within the next few years

The thing is, though, that $950k is more than enough for me, and I'm young. I could pursue business interests, invest in something to pour my time/energy into, move anywhere. I'm just wary on what to do and I'm a little overwhelmed. Any advice?",1,Inherited large amount of equity.. Not sure whether to liquidate and invest now or wait

Worried_individual_,"Hi guys I'm a 19 year old kid and I've invested into Tesla, so far I got return of around $900 and the number increases everyday.

Why do people overcomplicate it and make it seem like it's more than it is? For me it's as simple as selling high and buying low I've made some minor mistakes but right now I'm pretty confident in it. I don't really do any research on the company and it may seem arrogant but it is what it is.

Whenever I tried learning more it's full of people who think they're the shit or a bunch of gibberish, ""you will lose money"", ""this is gambling"" ""you're young spend it somewhere else"" 

So what exactly is stock trading in simple terms, how do I know when to buy and when to sell, what sort of things should I look at? I seen on twitter loads of people that made some right calls early on a stock that became big the next day, how do I become one of em?

somalley3,"22 (m) working in finance, i currently split rent in a one bedroom with serious girl friend, and i’ve spent some time reflecting recently on how inclined i am to actually buy a house in the intermediate term. I’m less looking for advice on personal finance because i know there are better subreddits on that, but I wanted to raise conversation and see others’ insights on using a single family house as a practical vehicle for growing wealth in house equity. I’m familiar with the pros and cons of renting vs owning a home and i’ve read Rich Dad Poor Dad so no need to remind me that a home for many is actually a liability, i’m more thinking about let’s say the next 5-7 years whether it makes more sense to rent over an extended period of time and plow more money into equities or to build equity in a home by getting a mortgage. I know there’s lots of nuances to this and i consider myself to be a knowledgeable and reasonably sophisticated investor (at least with my own money) so i don’t need tips on how to allocate the difference necessarily, but the crux of my question boils down to over an intermediate 5-7 ish year time frame whether it’s more effective to build wealth generally in a diversified equities portfolio with increased marginal contributions rather than saving up for a downpayment on a house while continuing to rent, or save up for a down payment and use leverage from a mortgage to build real estate equity. Note, not looking for a house to ‘settle down’ in long term because i recognize the right house for a family has qualitative values not measurable or relevant to an investment analysis. Speaking purely from an investment stand point, i’m wondering whether a leveraged real estate investment (which is how i would think of a house if i bought one now) and all the costs associated as well as the equity in a booming real estate market compares with expected equity returns in medium term. part of my concern here is that neither stocks nor housing seem cheap, especially not in my area right now, but buying a house requires using leverage to enter a record hot asset class while continuing to rent and pouring more into stocks (in roth accounts and then taxable) feels like a more moderate decision.

FearlessNL,"# Companhia Siderúrgica Nacional S.A. Analysis (Ticker: SID)

*An integrated steel company that is criminally undervalued*

# A general understanding of the business.

Companhia Siderúrgica Nacional is a Brazilian corporation incorporated in 1941. The Presidente Vargas Steelworks, located in the city of Volta Redonda, in the state of Rio de Janeiro, began its production of coke, pig iron and steel products in 1946, when they also incorporated the Casa de Pedra mine, located in the city of Congonhas, state of Minas Gerais, and the Arcos mine, located in the city of Arcos, state of Minas Gerais. The Casa de Pedra mine assures self-sufficiency in iron ore and the Arcos mine provides limestone and dolomite.

CSN was privatized through a series of auctions held in 1993 and early 1994, through which the Brazilian government sold its 91% ownership interest. The company began trading on the NYSE in 1997. It has a market cap of \~$6.1B with a share price of $4.46 at the time of writing.

*Current operations*

CSN is currently one of the largest integrated steel producers in Latin America in terms of crude steel production, they produced 11.3% of Brazil’s total crude steel production in 2020. They operate throughout the entire steel production chain, meaning they do everything from mining the ore to the sale of steel products. Their business can be separated in five segments: steel, mining, cement, logistics and energy.

*Steel*

CSN’s current annual crude steel capacity at their main facility is about 5.6 million tons. With an additional production capacity of 1.1 million tons of steel at their long steel segment in Germany. They obtain all their iron ore (and other products) from their own mines.

*Mining activities*

As previously mentioned, CSN obtains all their iron ore from their own mines. However, they sold 29.6 million tons, 34.9 million tons and 26.9 million tons of iron ore to third parties in 2018, 2019 and 2020, respectively. Their mines are strategically located within Brazil’s “Iron Ore Quadrangle” within the state of Minas Gerais.

*Logistics*

CSN holds stakes in and operates many business that operate in transportation of goods. They operate a port terminal for containers, called TECON. They also have participation in 3 railways.

*Cement*

CSN entered the cement industry in 2009 to take advantage of the synergy potential with their steelmaking business. They have gradually invested in their cement segment, with the most recent being the acquisition of the Brazilian business of LafargeHolcim for $1 billion. They also acquired Elizabeth Cimentos for a value of $214 million in July of this year.

*Electricity*

Steelmaking requires significant amounts of electricity to power rolling mills, production lines, hot metal processing, coking plants, cryogenic plant and auxiliary units. They produce most of the electricity from a power-plant at their main facility which secures them about 235 MW of capacity. In addition, they secure on average 188 MW through various equity interests.

# Valuation &amp; Growth

CSN isn’t a fancy EV company with revenue growing 1000% YOY, however they are growing fast compared to peers. Their earnings per share (EPS) has grown at an annual 38.3% over the past 5 years. They are also investing profits back into their own business through acquisitions. The insiders of this company are focused on growing the company considering they have a 54.5% stake.

Some statistics about the valuation of CSN:

P/E: 2.26  
P/Free Cash Flow: 2.68  
PEG: 0.58  
Return On Equity: 117.7%  
Return On Assets: 22.3%  
Return On Investment: 11.1%

This company has a price to free cash flow of 2.68. Which means with no growth at all it will have made its own market cap in profits in a little more than 2,5 years. They are also investing back heavily into their own business.

The average company in the steel-making industry has a P/E of 5.88, even though this isn’t a full-on steel company it is still noteworthy that it is trading at a P/E that is nearly 3 times lower than their main industry average. If we would value CSN at a P/E of 5.88 we would obtain a price of $11.88 indicating an increase of over 166%.

The estimated CAGR of the steel industry in the next 5 years is 4%, if we do a simple DCF analysis, with the assumptions of 4% growth over the next 5 years and a 2% growth rate in the years after, we get a fair enterprise value of $22.9B, compared to the current EV of $8.48B. This would also indicate a share price of around $12.00 (specifically $12.04).

The stock of CSN ($SID) has been more than cut in half in the recent months. This creates a wonderful buying opportunity for investors looking for value and growth. If you are interested in this company I would encourage you to read the 20-F (10-K for foreign companies) for yourself and decide if this is a good investment. After all I am just an individual and not a hedge fund, have fun investing!

auser24,"Let's say the FED starts rising rates to contain inflation at some point in the future, which would hurt stocks. If this happens I want to have some exposure to asset classes that would benefit from an increase in rates. What would be the best options for this? Bonds are the first thing that comes to mind, but I can see some drawbacks, specially if we're talking about an inflationary scenario:

- Even with a rise in rates, nominal yields will likely stay below inflation on treasury bonds, yielding negative real returns. I don't see the FED rising rates to 3%+ anytime in the near future.
- I would have to hold the bond until maturity, selling it would be bad if rates keep rising because price is inversely correlated to yield. 

Are these assumptions correct? If so, are there better alternatives? TIPS does not sound like an alternative, its yield being bond yield minus inflation, so if bonds are below inflation so will TIPS (which is the current scenario, TIPS having negative yield). Gold price is inversely correlated to yields so it's a no-go. Crypto is high risk and I expect it would behave like so, with prices also falling, though it's hard to say. Are 1-2y bonds or CDs the best option here if I don't want to hold bonds for 10y?

Hey all, 

first off as a disclaimer there are never any guarantees with things like this. It may well turn out to be a Ponzi scheme and there are always risks which is why you should always take profit along the way and never spend more then what you can afford to lose. In saying that however I have personally made money out of this and short term (over the next year or so), I think this is a great little passive income earner. 

The site is called Upistic. You deposit crypto and it is locked in for a 20 day period. The deposited amounts are then used by Upistic’s own traders to trade Defi tokens in currency exchanges providing daily profits back to the initial investors (you). Depending how the traders perform each day you are guaranteed 1.3 - 2.3 percent daily on your investment to which you can watch generate in real time. You are also able to withdraw your profits daily or you also have the option to reinvest and compound to make increase profits. 

Like I said earlier this may sound too good to be true long term however short term, this is a great little money maker which many people are currently invested into.

10xwannabe,"I wanted to throw this out there as a quick example mostly for our younger investors who may not appreciate in relation to time how money compounds in real life (hint doesn't feel like a straight line).

Here is an example of a situation a real life investor might experience:

If you take a 30 year old and he/ she starts to invest $1500/ month (18k/ year) for 30 years (until age 60) at a imaginary 8% return per year he/she will end up with 2+ MILLION.  

That is the type of example everyone has seen, but here is what most fail to appreciate which makes investing hard for many folks even with the best intentions...

1/2 of that return (1 MILLION) was gained only in the last 7-8 years of that 30 year period.  So even if the investor was diligent and did what he/ she was supposed to do they would have felt like they weren't making any progress, i.e. spinning the wheels for the first 22 years or so!  In fact, waiting for high growth at the end is NORMAL.  Folks get bummed out they aren't millionaires after about 1, 3, 5, even 10 years, but the above person ended up with 50% of all their future money to spend in the last 8 years or so (age 52-60 in this example).

Just an observation that may help others.  The point being once  you have an set asset allocation your job is just to be a robot and save EACH month over and over again and don't worry about the total $$$ in your accounts.  The latter you won't appreciate until the end of the journey (20+ years later from when you started).

I recently took some really big losses on Facebook and I want to realize those losses during the 2021 year but at the same time I want to hold the stock because I like the investment so I’m thinking that I should just sell all of it this December 30th right before the end of the year and then buy it again 31 days later in 2022.

wookie767," **$FB into earnings this Monday, AH.** 

I'm taking a minority view here on Facebook, and believe it'll breakout after earnings, in spite of;

1. regulatory pressures from Congress
2. SNAP's harbinger of advertising headwinds
3. Stock prices dropping after each of the last three ER's.

However, to hedge against IV crush if the price action goes bearish, I took a \*\*December Vertical Call Spread.\*\* 

(read further for rationale)===========

. The expected ER is $3.19, compared to last quarter's $3.61 actual.

. FB in their conference call had already mentioned Apple's algo

. While SNAP was greatly affected by AAPL and thus dropped a quarter of it's price, FB is far bigger and has multiple revenue streams. The impact will be minimal, and think that it will surpass estimates, top and bottom.

. POC on the daily chart (from last ER until today), is at $341, which was in the range of yesterday's trade.

. Post-ER, I'm expecting it to reach above POC (as to how far up will depend on guidance).

. Whichever way price goes post-ER, expect the price to settle around POC level. Hence, a vertical debit spread for Dec, 330/335C was a safe bet to end in profit, with a max of 110%.

The opportunity here is to capitalize on the limited amount of IPv4 addresses in open circulation. The risk is that IPv6 adoption will occur sufficiently prior to any price increase and will result in loss of demand in IPv4.  Put differently, this is a bet that companies which are unwilling, or unable, to fully adopt IPv6 will pay a significant premium to continue doing business using their current tech.  


The price of IPv4 addresses has risen from \~$8/ea in 2014 to $50/ea in 2021 ([1.](https://i.imgur.com/EqW5jKn.png))  


* One concern here is that price growth was flat in 2019 before it started growing sharply in 2020. This might be indicative of a short-term bubble due to unexpected increase demand in remote needs.
* This is a relatively high-volume market. There are tens of millions in transactions occurring weekly. ([2.](https://i.imgur.com/nbMvpKZ.png))
* You must hold purchases for two years before they are able to be resold. ([3.](https://ipv4marketgroup.com/arin34/))

IPv6 adoption has grown from 3% to 38% from 2014 to 2021. [(4.)](https://i.imgur.com/ItptmoP.png)  


* Adoption growth is linear and *slowing* \- adoption has not quickened in response to the IPv4 price hike.
* Adoption has been far slower than anticipated. ""On 7 March 2013, the Internet Engineering Task Force created a working group for IPv4 sunset ... in May 2018 this working group was closed as no immediate work could be identified due to the slow transition to IPv6."" ([5.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPv6_deployment#Coexistence_with_IPv4))  


I think this is a good play for me personally because:  


* I work in tech and feel I understand the needs of tech decently well.
* I am looking for a 'collectible' asset for part of my portfolio. I see IPv4 addresses as something similar to investing in M:TG cards, for example. I want to hold slightly less cash without investing more into stocks or cryptocurrency.
* I do not have any reservations about holding for half a decade. This is a small amount of money (\~5% of portfolio) and have absolutely no intent of selling within two years.

Anonymous is a group I have grown up with. For those that are too young (or too old) to know, Anonymous is a pseudo-group that sprung to life on 4chan in the early 2000s. They have a colorful history of lighthearted hacking, to taking on the entire organizational structure of Scientology. They have a history of taking matters into their own hands through leveraging the power of the Internet and technology when our prevailing systems fail. You might have seen that they have their hands in Mr. Trump's app already, but that isn't why I bring them up. I bring them up as an example of what the Internet really is. Anonymous is ""nobody, and everybody"". You can buy a Guy Fawkes mask, put it on, and reasonably claim to be part of this faceless mob. THAT is who the Internet is for, without exception. The User. The Internet NEEDS to be for ""nobody, and everybody"", all at once, or it fails.

This finding is consistent with the view that excessive analyst coverage, driven by investment banking incentives and analyst self-interests, raises investor optimism causing share prices to trade above fundamental value. However, weak analyst coverage causes stocks to trade below fundamental values. This finding indicates that investors tend to believe that these firms are more likely to be plagued by information asymmetries and agency problems.

HistoricallyMeans,"As the world gradually shifts to renewable energy, advancement of technologies involve a lot of renewable energy projects, the demand for copper just keeps on increasing. A lot of companies struggle to provide and respond to this demand, but there are recent issues going on with bigger companies. 

Due to the restrictions caused by the pandemic, BHP’s Escondida mine has issues in operation, resulting in a drop in their copper production. Codelco’s copper production took a dip recently, going down by 6.7% with their produce after a strike in one of their mines. Now this is critical, since both companies are mining Chile, and the country is known to be top copper producer in the world.

But as the world grapples with the copper shortage and the price surges this year, I believe smaller companies that already started producing and some that are still drilling are showing great potential to help provide and match the demand.

One miner that could be an excellent player would be [Copper Mountain Mining](https://cumtn.com/) ([CMMC](https://www.google.com/finance/quote/CMMC:TSE)). Their flagship asset is the 75% owned Copper Mountain mine located in southern British Columbia near the town of Princeton, and they are currently producing approximately 100 million pounds of copper equivalent, with average annual production expected to increase to approximately 140 million pounds of copper equivalent. They recently released drill results at their Cameron Copper Project in Australia, where three large mineralized zones are identified.

[Solaris Resources](https://www.solarisresources.com/) ([SLS](https://www.google.com/finance/quote/SLS:TSE)), on the other hand, boasts the Warintza copper project in Ecuador, and this mine is along a mineral belt that hosts Lundin Gold’s Fruta del Norte Mine and a Chinese consortium’s Mirador mine, about 40 km to the south.  They have a massive cash cushion and their cash burn is way under, which can be considered as a good sign. They have about $60 million on the balance sheet right now and approximately $20 million needed for the remaining 2021 CAPEX. Their shares increased more than 8% recently after the price of copper increased throughout the week to $4.2435. 

I am looking forward to seeing the growth of [Fortitude Gold](https://www.fortitudegold.com/) ([FTCO](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/FTCO/)). They’re a small producer, but it is worth considering that they have no debts. They also [reported positive metallurgical test results](https://www.fortitudegold.com/news/fortitude-gold-reports-positive-golden-mile-metallurgical-test-results) from its Golden Mile property with column leach tests reporting up to 85% gold recovery. They also recently increased its monthly dividend by 14% and intercepted numerous high grade gold intercepts in untested open areas.

With global climate goals demanding for more copper, copper mining companies will need to strive to produce. There have been issues going in Peru and Chile, since its governments is threatening to increase mining taxes and regulations. With the increasing demand and the increasing prices, a lot of industries that utilize will encounter a lot of issue unless the need for the precious metals gets matched by production.",1,Will the recent copper shortage be an opportunity for smaller miners?

I have a number of other stocks i trade or hold but these are a handful of the companies I really believe in longterm with the exception of maybe snapchat. I just had to note that one due to the 22% sell-off we are seeing after hours...

Netflix - reported solid numbers overall with eps coming in at 3.19, an 83% increase over the same period last year...they brought in 7.48 Bil in revenue and 1.45 Bil in net profits. They added 4.38 million new paid subscribers and expect that number to double next quarter, bringing the total count to 213.6 million. I believe the price action to the upside is justified and will continue. 

Tesla - best quarter yet for the ev car maker ! 13.76 Bil in revenue and 1.6 Bil in net profits. Gross profit margin increased to 26.6%. They delivered 241,300 vehicles and total production came in at 237,823. Numbers looking good and the price action/sentiment is very strong. Arkk base case for tesla shares is steep but starting to sound like a very possible reality. if the stock breaks above the previous all-time-highs of 900.40 we should see a decent move to the upside. I'm thinking 1k could come quick. 

SNAP - down 22% after hours on a fairly decent Q3 report...fwd p/e is a little high so it doesn't surprise me. Investors want a big beat on these growth companies sometimes and push the price down hard if eps doesn't come in much higher than expectations 

Shopify - earnings coming up next week on October 8th along with Amazon...growth is not appearing to slow up in 2021. Looks to me like they started ballooning as a company at the perfect time. They were well positioned to take advantage of the lock downs and have managed to maintain strong sales moving forward as things begin to open back up to some degree. I do not believe a full reopening of the economy would hurt the company at all. In fact it would likely be a driving factor for more growth and would help them sure up their position in the e-commerce sector. Nothing to report here yet for Q3 but i will be waiting patiently.

the_arbitrage_guy,"I don’t know how aware/interested people are in sport arbitrage ‘betting’. It says ‘betting’, however I believe it is an investment as there is no real ‘bet’ involved. Arbitrage betting is when two different bookmakers disagree on the odds of a two-way market (only two possible outcomes), therefore meaning if you bet on both sides of the market you will certainly make a small profit. An example will make things much easier:

SWEDEN VS KOSOVO - 9TH OCTOBER

MARKET - BOTH TEAMS TO SCORE

BET 1: MANSION BET (YES) ODDS - 2.45 (STAKE £125) (Potential return £306)

BET 2: BETVICTOR (NO) ODDS - 1.75 (STAKE £175) (Potential return £306)

1 bet will win the other will lose, but either way we will get back £306, when we only staked £300, this is a 2% ROI .

A 2% profit doesn’t seem like much in betting terms and is smirked at in betting communities but when you look at it as an investment it’s very exciting, I usually place arbs between 2-5%.

So why am I not a millionaire as this is essentially free money. This is the bad news; bookies don’t like it (it’s not illegal though) because they will certainly lose money over time. It’s easy to spot a foolish arbitrage bettor as they will bet on games in the Syrian 4th division etc. Therefore, there are many rules you must abide to arbitrage bet successfully. The main aim is to look like you are a punter, find arbs that are in high volume markets (top European football leagues), bet round numbers (not £97.65 etc) and at normal betting times. Eventually they will catch on to you and limit/close your betting accounts, but you can easily make a couple of thousand before then.

* Broker: TDA
* Bear Call spread: $25/$35

On the day of expiry, the price of the underlying is at $29. So, the broker will do the assignment at 3:00 PM.

For clarity, my understanding of the basics of what will happen is, you have to sell the shares for $25, but have to pay $35 to get them. 

Now, if they did only the first leg of the assignment, you would own (negative) 100 shares, until the second half was executed, correct? This could happen if the $25 half of the spread is called by the holder of the contract before expiry, correct?

With that understood... Now, suppose you said that morning, well $29 is cheaper than $35, I'm just going to buy the shares now, before it gets assigned.  

It seems you could now sell the $35 call (likely for pennies), and thus reduce your loss to $400 instead of $1k?

* would buying the shares simply remove the $35 leg of the spread?
* If no, would TDA even execute that leg?

Vivid-Firefighter982,"This post is a summary of comments on threads and blog posts comparing traditional IRAs to Roths. In particular, I wanted to comment on and offer some arguments against 5 major points that find their way into many of the comparison threads.

**1st sentiment to dispute: low income earners who expect to make more later should do Roths, high income earners who expect to make less later should do traditional.**

I have seen this point a few times:

&gt;If you’re in a high bracket and expect little or no income in retirement take traditional. Otherwise if you’re in a low bracket now and expect more income in retirement take Roth. Or just do both.

This is how I used to think and on the surface, it is an accurate statement. I myself am currently in a high earning tax bracket, and have favored traditional IRAs historically assuming that I'll be making less in retirement. And that is true, I will have more available cash at the current time and will be paying a lower effective tax rate at the time of withdrawal.

There's one major problem: while it is true that for high income earners using a Roth you are paying a higher current tax rate, *you are paying a 0% tax rate on your gains.* This 0% tax on capital gains usually outweighs the taxes saved at time of deposit with a traditional IRA. What's even worse is that this money is taxed as ordinary income instead of as capital gains.

\-

**2nd point to dispute: the investment accounts work out to be the same over time.**

This leads me to the next sleight-of-hand that a lot of traditional IRA advocates try to pull. Take a look at [this Excel sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1kZ7Qnwh1lsi87to4LpgBbVHDb3iJ7nH1-7pONCzU3yo/edit) that calculates gains for traditional vs Roth.

Now it's tempting to look at these numbers and think ""Oh see, there you go. It doesn't matter, you end up with the same money either way."" But look at the assumptions this sheet is making: Instead of having you max out your Roth, it assumes that the 5k you were going to put into your traditional IRA is reduced to 3.5k with your Roth. This is not what happens and is such a dramatic error that I think it's intentional -- who doesn't max out their Roth if they can? You're not depositing less, you're depositing the maximum and paying more in taxes (ie. losing available cash). Then, you make the same gains but with a Roth they're not taxed.

Using the scenario in the linked Excel chart we can more accurately reflect what happens for most people: you have $1250 of extra available cash each year with a traditional. 1250 x 12 = $15k over 12 years that you would have had at the cost of of $18.3k of additional taxes at retirement (with a Roth paying 37% taxes now vs with a traditional IRA paying 22% at retirement).

If you want to do the numbers again, here is another example taken from a comment comparing IRAs to Roths with the following math:

&gt;assuming 30% tax  
&gt;  
&gt;10,000 = 7,000 after tax going into roth = $122,145.82 after 30years @ 10%  
&gt;  
&gt;10,000 full going into trad/401k = $174,494 after 30years @ 10% = $122,145.82 after paying 30% tax.

This is disingenuous. Remember, a Roth is not ""tax free"" but *post-tax*. The numbers evolve differently if you are maxing your IRA out.

* *Roth investment*: 15,900 = 10,000 after tax going into Roth at 37% tax rate = $175k after 30 years at 10% - $5,900 of less available cash at the time of deposit (with a higher tax rate and principal) + $54k gained (""tax free"" or post-tax gains) at the time of withdrawal = **$49.7k overall gains.**
* *Traditional investment*: 10,000 pre-tax going into traditional IRA with $5.9k more available cash at time of deposit, in exchange for 22% tax rate at retirement instead of 37% at time of deposit as would have occurred with a Roth = $175k after 30 years; 54k gained but taxed at 22% instead of 37% = **42k overall gains.** In most of the scenarios I calculated, Roths came out ahead in the long run.

So, taking into account the different expected tax rates, with a traditional IRA you are giving up 7k of long term gains for an additional 5.9k of available cash at the current time. What you do with this money determines its *opportunity cost*.

This is a stronger [retirement tool](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1VZ4wKbUXdc8VA0mG4ri2wP9VuZCwae7b9MvA4u2HT7w/copy) developed by u/jeff_varszegi from [this recent post](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/owf0zi/spreadsheet_roth_vs_traditional_401ks_and_iras/) if any of you are familiar. There are some aspects that caught my attention as needing refinement (discussed [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/owf0zi/spreadsheet_roth_vs_traditional_401ks_and_iras/hhdvbrq/?context=3)), but my understanding is very basic and I could be missing something.

**3rd point to dispute: An anti-Roth post at Go Curry Cracker**

There is a well known anti-Roth post at Go Curry Cracker entitled ""The Great Roth Controversy"" (I can't link the url as it is not allowed in the subreddit). The amount of mental gymnastics that the post undergoes to make its points is staggering:

&gt;Dollars saved in a Traditional 401k / IRA are pre-tax.  We pay no income tax on dollars going in, an immediate savings of up to 39.6%, the highest marginal rate.  The invested funds are allowed to grow **tax free**, so all interest, dividends, and capital gains are untaxed until withdrawn from the account.  Upon withdrawal, all funds are treated as ordinary income, similar to a paycheck.

This is very inaccurate wording. The invested funds in an IRA don't grow ""tax free"". As said by the author themselves in the first sentence, they grow **pre-tax**. The invested funds in a Roth also don't grow ""tax free"" but **post-tax**. This is the major benefit of a Roth over traditional.

Then the post starts talking about theoretical scenarios where a family would be paying 40% taxes with a Roth but would be reduced to poverty level income in retirement -- the so called ""first and last dollar"" argument. This is incredibly misleading. Instead it should be a ""last and last dollar"" argument. What are you paying as far as a marginal tax rate on the Traditional vs the Roth -- ie. what would an individual have been making otherwise. You have to take into account other income streams to know your base income and effective/marginal tax rates.

Another point made in this blog is that the greater available cash with a traditional IRA can then be used to invest in an index fund anyways, functionally becoming a Roth at annual capital gains tax rates. First off, why wouldn't you want post-tax gains? The point they leave unspoken is you're paying a premium for more available cash at the current time with a traditional IRA. And that's assuming an individual invests this money -- the average person is actually just redistributing savings.

For high earners that will earn less at retirement, a Roth requires a higher initial investment, but with the benefit of greater long term cash gains. With a traditional IRA, on the other hand, you are functionally increasing *available cash* because you're paying the lower tax rate that will exist when you retire. This is at the expense of *post-tax gains*.

For low earners that expect to earn *more* at retirement than they are currently, a Roth will have a lower tax rate fixed at the time of deposit as well as the ""tax-free"" gains. This is a double-win scenario with a Roth. If they had invested in a traditional IRA, it would have been a double loss.

\-

**4th point to dispute: It's pointless to try to predict the future.**

Another argument I've heard is that tax rates are difficult to predict in the future. While researching this idea I came across the following charts:

I'm not a tax expert, but from these it appears fairly reasonable to guess that incremental tax brackets won't be changing dramatically in the next few decades. If I am understanding trends shown in the linked charts, if I'm in a higher income tax bracket at retirement, then I will be paying lower taxes than now and if I'm in a lower income tax bracket at retirement (which is more likely if I haven't developed passive income) I will be paying higher taxes than now.

The more important point, as shown in the math above, is that for the average person, *tax rates* matter less than *post-tax ('tax-free') gains.* That is to say: the amount you gain in a post-tax retirement account will usually be more than the amount you save by a lower effective tax rate in a pre-tax retirement account, even in a top tax bracket.

Of course this is not a guarantee. Your Roths could be invested poorly, there could be a revolution and the entire tax structure we've had for the last century could be changed to a universal standard tax rate, you could win the lottery, etc. but at some point we have to accept that we're dealing with probabilities. If you haven't developed a cumulatively progressive source of passive income *and* you're not in a defined hierarchy (ie. a partnership track in a law firm or medical group, a path to senior management at a large corporation, etc) or you sell a product that can be leveraged to economies of scale (ie. a brand-name app), you will probably be in an eat-what-you-kill situation at retirement and so be making less in retirement than you are in middle age.

\-

**5th point to dispute: That there are universal solutions. Remember:** ***one size fits all is a size that fits none.***

**A comment I've come across is that having both a traditional IRA and a Roth is good because you're ""diversifying"".** The reasoning behind this is that a traditional IRA will be counted as part of taxable income in retirement and a Roth can be used for additional tax-free withdrawals that would put one out of their desired tax bracket.

This doesn't make sense as a general rule and must be calculated for your individual circumstances. By my own personal math, for example, it is a bad idea for me to do a traditional IRA because the lower tax rate at retirement would not compensate for the tax-free gains of a Roth. This is an example of where something that sounds like good advice (ie. ""It's always good to diversify."") actually takes you down a less financially successful path.

Another point to keep in mind is that your year to year tax situation matters a great deal. Let's say you retire early, get laid off or have a year where you are transitioning jobs so your income is low. This is a great opportunity for a Roth IRA conversion ladder -- ie. moving your pre-tax (IRA/401k) money into to post tax (Roth) accounts. Use this year as an opportunity to pay the lower effective tax rate at deposit *and* get the benefits of post-tax gains. A double-whammy of tax gains.

Looking at your specific life circumstances make it more likely that you will pick the retirement portfolio that applies to your particular path. Barring extreme examples, however, a Roth will be the better choice for most.",1,Lies My Accountant Told Me or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Roth

ithinktherefore88,"Hello there! I'm trying to wrap my head around bond fund pricing during rising rates.

Lets say rates rise. Bond funds drop in price because people are selling their older bonds with lower interest rates. Because of this the bond fund pays a higher % dividend relative to share price. 

Now, does the fund pay more interest because the fund sold the old bonds and bought new ones with higher interest? Or is it just the market pricing in the fund with the fund owning the same lower yield bonds? 

And finally, as the lower yield bonds mature in the fund, and higher yield bonds are bought, does that mean the bond fund price will rise, since the total yield relative to price of the fund grows, as old bonds mature? 

Basically, I'm trying to figure out if bond funds only take temporary hits from rising rates and eventually recover in principal price.

&amp;#x200B;

* **VTI - 30.00%** \- I find it adequate for the portfolio profile
* **TLT - 40.00%** \- With an increase in rates in the next few years, this could be a weak point of the portfolio as it is long-term bonds +10 years.
* **IEF - 15.00%** \- They also have sensitivity to rate increases, although it is shorter term, so it would be more tolerable.
* **DBC - 7.50%** \- I do not like commodities personally, although I understand in this portfolio the objective is to look for uncorrelated assets
* **GLD - 7.50%** \- I do not like gold personally, although I understand in this portfolio the objective is to look for uncorrelated assets

Historical:

Performance from 2013 to 2021: 7.90% YoY / Standard Dev 6.51% / Worst Year -3.25%

&amp;#x200B;

**Updated Portfolio**

So considering the above, I gave myself the task of trying to adapt the previous portfolio to reduce the possible ""risks"" that I see, with few changes, resulting in the following:

&amp;#x200B;

* **VTI - 30.00%** \- Same
* **TLT - 20.00%** \- It is reduced to 20% to reduce the risk of an increase in rates
* **IEF - 15.00%** \- Same
* **DBC - 7.50% to XLU** \- It is eliminated from the portfolio and replaced with ""utilities"" (ETF XLU), since it is an asset that has a similar correlation to commodities but a superior performance
* **GLD - 7.50%** \- Same
* **BNDX - 20%** \- International bonds from developed countries are added, which reduce the risk of TLT.

Wisser95,"**Long Electronic Arts ($EA)**

Electronic Arts develops and sells video games. IP includes games such as Battlefield, The Sims, and FIFA.

A substantial portion of EA’s revenue is generated from *Ultimate Team* in EA’s sports games. Based on last FY, *Ultimate Team* brings in $1.62b or 29% of EA’s total revenue. In *Ultimate Team* gamers can collect digital player cards and build their own personalised team. Buying digital loot boxes with real money is a way to speed up that process.

On June 18th, EA [introduced](https://www.ea.com/en-gb/games/fifa/fifa-21/news/pitch-notes-fifa21-preview-packs) *Preview Packs* to *Ultimate Team*. These new type of loot boxes lets the player see what’s inside the loot box before buying. My thesis is that these new loot boxes are underappreciated by EA’s investors. The general idea here is that opening one of those loot boxes is like playing the casino, and EA is drawing more players into the casino by now handing out a free first round of loot boxes every day. To see why this works, just imagine what would happen with Philip Morris if it was able to hand every single human a couple of free cigarette puffs every single day!

The introduction of *Preview Packs* is seen by [some](https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2021-06-18-ea-adds-ultimate-team-loot-boxes-that-let-you-see-all-items-before-you-buy-in-most-significant-shakeup-of-fifa-series-in-years) as EA’s response to the increasing pressure from governments about the link between loot boxes and (underage) gambling. My firm opinion is that *Preview Packs* will generate more, and not less, revenue for EA.

The beauty of all of this is that the additional revenue from *Preview Packs* translates almost fully into bottom-line profit. Distributing one additional DIGITAL loot box comes with almost zero additional costs for EA. Revenue = profit. *Preview Packs* will thus lead to a significant boost in EBIT. To put it all in perspective, EA’s last FY revenue was $5.63b of which $1.62b *Ultimate Team* revenue, and EBIT is $1.05b. Let’s conservatively assume that *Preview Packs* leads to a 10% boost in *Ultimate Team* revenue. That’s $162m. Add that to EBIT and EBIT grows by 15.5%. That’s some nice operating leverage.

About timing. *Preview Packs* were temporarily available during the EURO2020 tournament for \~6 wks following June 18th. In earnings call 1Q2021 (qtr ending June 30rd), EA indicated that preview packs were successful and that they’ve seen increased engagement and higher rate of conversion. *Preview Packs* were then made available on a permanent basis with the launch of FIFA22 on October 1st. Because of *Preview Packs*, I expect *Ultimate Team* revenue will break records and market expectations. I expect to remain long for at least 3 months, waiting for 3Q2021 earnings (qtr ending December 31st) that should demonstrate the profitability of *Preview Packs* to EA’s investors.

Note that my investment is purely based on a puzzle piece that I think the market is missing. I have no view on the remainder of EA’s business but am nevertheless exposed to this. I am just betting on the market missing the *Preview Packs* puzzle piece. Thus, I might lose my bet for other reasons than being wrong on my investment thesis (e.g. Battlefield2042 might flop or EA correcting from a possible overvaluation). Nevertheless, I like the bet.",1,Long Electronic Arts ($EA)

* I could go for a structure of 20 minutes spent teaching people about something, depending on previous knowledge, ranging from talking about stocks and ETFs to options or crypto staking/minig/trading, followed by 40 minutes of discussing investment strategies and the news relating to it.
* It could be a glorified social club with some fianncial discussion and news.
* It could be like a financial firm simulation, where I take $100 out of my current investment account and use a brokerage with fractional shares, where everyone pitches a stock or ETF, similar to the concept going on at r/InvestmentClub.

EthicallyIlliterate,"I am a fairly new investor, I began in 2017. It has obviously been a stellar few years, did covid even happen?

I have a close relationship with an old professor of mine who teaches investments at the college level, we often chat. He was a derivatives trader for 20 years back in the 80s and 90s.

He swears and insists that when rates begin to rise the market is going to absolutely eat shit, and most if not all valuations will drop. He says that the market has been hooked on the feds liquidity since ‘08 and the withdrawals will be severe. He has been slowly divesting the past few months.

I see where he is coming from, and he is obviously much wiser than me. In class he would always preach about if a stock falls 50% you need 100% gain to make your money back, therefore avoiding downside is much better than missing a little upside, which I also agree with.

What I am not so sure of is that rising rates will spell doom for the markets. The most I could see is maybe slowed growth? But if rates steadily climb to around 4% on the 10 year that would actually be GOOD For the economy.

Thebirv,"Hello,

I have one loan for my primary residence and one loan for 2nd vacation home that I use as a short term rental.  I've recently learned that for the next short term rental I buy it will be considered a pure investment property so instead of 10% down I would be required to do 20% down.

&amp;#x200B;

Enter a business partner of mine.  He has no current home loan since he's living on a military base for the next couple years.  Can he take out a loan to be considered 2nd home/vacation home for us to utilize 10% down instead of 20 (non va, I know that's not an option)?

&amp;#x200B;

Would this impact his ability to use a VA loan 2-3 years from now when he's ready to buy his primary residence?

Can I and one other business partner be on the loan and deed if he were to take it?

$TBLT : https://youtu.be/5sRJreGE2i4

And here i explained why Asensus is a good buy for short term. Anthony Fernando is really smart. They announced one Senhance purchase from Russia and one from Japan.  However they didn't use the word purchase for Japan. So i believe it is a leasing contract. 
But the interesting point is the date of announcement.  One 27 th and other 29 th September. Exactly before end of Q3. now :
Last quarter revenue without any sales was 1.1 million and EPS -0.07 . Revenue earned through 30 active Senhances .they are performing around 500 surgery per quarter. Company has a solid passive income. now if we assume each Senhance cost around 1.2 million and even if we don't count leasing contract from Japan, it means Q3 revenue should be more than 2.3 million. That means more than 100% than last quarter and i expect 25% or 50% better EPS than last quarter.  So in my eyes Asensus is shining as a good buy opportunity . Personally i will consider purchasing some shares one week before Q3 earning call. Of course not a financial advice and it's just my personal thoughts :)

I've saved up $4,000 and I want to put a part of that into the market, I'm currently 19 years old. I wanted to be a stockbroker when I was younger so I know a bit more about types of investments and how to read stocks. But, I've never invested really besides a few dollars. I'm just a bit nervous!

I was thinking of investing $100 to $200 a month into my Stocks, bonds, REIT's and funds ( $1,200 to $2,400 a year ) which I think is a pretty good idea!

Shanemonksobyrne,"I am an avid collector of quotes. Each time I come across one that I like, I jot it down. Some of these are investing related, many are from other aspects of life. I have found Ben Graham - the grandfather of value investing, and mentor to Warren Buffett, to have some of the most actionable investment quotes out there. I dissected 14 of my favourite and discuss the lesson.

## 1. Quality &gt; Glamour

*“If you are shopping for common stocks, chose them the way you would buy groceries, not the way you would buy perfume.”*

Though a bit enigmatic, there is real meaning behind this quote from Graham. What does he mean?

**Buy high quality, good value, healthy companies** rather than companies that just look good at first *sniff.*

## 2. Growth ≠ Profits

*“Obvious prospects for physical growth in a business do not translate into obvious profits for investors.”*

**Beware of growth stocks.** Short term gain might mean long term pain.

## 3. Periodically review your holdings

“*Most businesses change in character and quality over the years, sometimes for the better, perhaps more often for the worse. The investor need not watch his companies’ performance like a hawk; but he should give it a good, hard look from time to time.”*

A good time to review your holdings is each rebalance period. For example, A quantitative investment  strategy might have a 1 month rebalance period. This means you will review your portfolio each month, selling some stocks and buying others.

## 4. Market Downturns are SERIOUS opportunities

*“Basically, price fluctuations have only one significant meaning for the true investor. They provide him with an opportunity to buy wisely when prices fall sharply and to sell wisely when they advance a great deal. At other times he will do better if he forgets about the stock market and pays attention to his dividend returns and to the operating results of his companies.”*

I’m a big believer that investors have the definition of risk slightly wrong. Most of the time, risk is interchanged with volatility. But they are not synonymous. *E*=mc2 , Paris is the capital of France, and stocks go up and down over time. The risk comes not from whether they go down (though this is important), but rather from how likely the individual is to sell the stock at precisely the wrong time.

**Market dips are great opportunities** to hop in and buy at amazing bargain prices. Just make sure you are ready to strike when the moment is right. Have cash ready to invest.

## 5. Investing vs. Speculating

*“The most realistic distinction between the investor and the speculator is found in their attitude toward stock-market movements. The speculator’s primary interest lies in anticipating and profiting from market fluctuations. The investor’s primary interest lies in acquiring and holding suitable securities at suitable prices. Market movements are important to him in a practical sense, because they alternately create low price levels at which he would be wise to buy and high price levels at which he certainly should refrain from buying and probably would be wise to sell.”*

Buy and Hold. A simple rule for long-term investing success. **Your time horizon needs to be 10 years or more. If it is not, you are gambling.**

## 6. Ensure you are buying high quality stocks

*“The risk of paying too high a price for good-quality stocks – while a real one – is not the chief hazard confronting the average buyer of securities. Observation over many years has taught us that the chief losses to investors come from the purchase of low-quality securities at times of favorable business conditions. The purchasers view the current good earnings as equivalent to “earning power” and assume that prosperity is synonymous with safety.”*

Warren Buffett initially adopted Graham’s Net-Net approach to buying stocks. a purely deep value approach. He was very successful in this method of investing, however as Berkshire Hathaway grew, this method of investing became unscalable, and so a quality-centric approach was adopted.

**Buy Undervalued, High quality companies.** For example, the Magic Formula (Joel Greenblatt) selects Deep value (Low EV / EBITDA) and good quality (High ROIC) companies.

## 7. There is risk in every investment

*“Even with a margin \[of safety\] in the investor’s favor, an individual security may work out badly. For the margin guarantees only that he has a better chance for profit than for loss – not that loss is impossible.”*

There is always a chance you’ve bought a bad egg. Just make sure you have more good eggs than bad ones. Its like winning an election: You don’t need every vote to win – you just need a majority! This analogy was taken from James Clear's book *Atomic Habits.*

## 8. Investment success is achievable

*“To achieve satisfactory investment results is easier than most people realize; to achieve superior results is harder than it looks.”*

Heres some formulas for you:

a) How to underperform the market: Pick stocks qualitatively

b) How to match the market: Buy an index fund

c) How to beat the market: Pick stocks quantitatively. Note: check out [my previous post](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/q6nj94/a_checklist_for_picking_great_stocks_warren/) on how to pick stocks quantitatively (using checklists).

## 9. Hold Fast

*“Most of the time stocks are subject to irrational and excessive price fluctuations in both directions as the consequence of the ingrained tendency of most people to speculate or gamble … to give way to hope, fear and greed.”*

Risk is how likely you are to sell. Reduce risk by NOT SELLING! Reduce risk by [creating an investment thesis](https://learn.aikido.finance/blog/post/how-to-create-an-investment-thesis/) that you cannot waver from.

## 10. Remember your history lessons

*“They used to say about the Bourbons that they forgot nothing and they learned nothing, and \[what\] I’ll say about the Wall Street people, typically, is that they learn nothing, and they forget everything.”*

Right now, this quote could not be more apt. The market is in a frenzy, with the [S&amp;P500 having a P/E ratio of 33](https://www.multpl.com/s-p-500-pe-ratio)! Let us not fall into the frenzy and leave our senses behind us. Remember what has happened during [bubbles](https://learn.aikido.finance/blog/post/5-signs-that-were-in-a-stock-market-bubble/) in the past: they pop. Use an investment strategy – quantify what you are doing.

## 11. Be careful of sexy products

*“In my experience marketability has proved of dubious overall advantage. It had led investors astray at least as much as it has helped them. It has made them stock-market minded instead of value-minded.”*

2000: You’ve gotta hear about this hot new .com company, its getting a lot of eyeballs!

2021: You’ve gotta hear about this cloud-based AI platform built on the blockchain!

Beware of sexy. Historically, IT has actually been one of the worst performing sectors of the stock market.

## 12. Be quantitative

*“operations should be based not on optimism but on arithmetic.”*

I need say no more. Be rules-based in everything you do. Use strategy, structures, systems. Not intuition. 

## 13. Be contrarian

*“Have the courage of your knowledge and experience. If you have formed a conclusion from the facts and if you know your judgment is sound, act on it – even though others may hesitate or differ. (You are neither right nor wrong because the crowd disagrees with you. You are right because your data and reasoning are right.)”*

The fishing is best where the fewest go, and the crowd is often wrong. You must go against the herd and in fact it is often better to go the exact opposite direction.

## 14. You don’t need to be smart, you just need a recipe

*“People don’t need extraordinary insight or intelligence. What they need most is the character to adopt simple rules and stick to them.”*

Don’t worry about trying to outsmart everyone else you don’t have to. What you need is patience and a good investment recipe. Time is your friend. Get your hand on a good investment cookbook of recipes.",1,The 14 Most Important Investing Lessons From Ben Graham
Whichwhenwhywhat,"Silver used to be only Golds little brother, but it has increasing industrial demand. Fundamentals about silver say two things: With increasing use for EV, electronics and solar panels silver is not only a monetary metal like gold, but also an industrial metal with increasing demand from these industries.

„Traditionally, silver prices have tracked gold prices fairly closely, which makes sense given that both function as monetary metals, and they often occur together in mineral deposits. The correlation between gold and silver since 1975 has been 0.8876. The 10-year correlation coefficient is 0.7511. However this year, the correlation has dropped significantly to 0.1959. The reason is the fact that both copper and silver are being increasingly demanded in green energy applications.“

(https://www.mining.com/web/silver-seen-tracking-copper-prices-higher/)

Other than Gold, Silver is increasingly used by industry:

After a bearish trend silver seems to have found a bottom and technical indicators turn bullish.

Looking at the supply situation it must be noted that Silver is mined mostly as a byproduct from other mining operations, but Silver is limited.

The question remains, will this scenario result in rising silver prices or can the price remain where it is?

Roughly speaking - arbitrage is an investment opportunity/strategy that never loses money, but has an opportunity to make it. 

With that being said - I'd like to think about the following strategy. AMEX cards currently allow users to venmo money at no cost - e.g. one can use their AMEX card with venmo for no fee. In some sense, one can use this to get interest free margin (for a period until the credit card bill is due) - venmo a trusted friend or relative using an AMEX card, and have them venmo you back. Thus, I propose the following:

1. Use the above mechanism to get some money into your bank account. 
2. Move the money into ultra short duration bonds, or even more safely, a high-yield savings account, like those of Ally bank. The nice thing about the savings account is there's no need to transact on a secondary market, and zero probability of paying any transaction costs.
3. Collect the interest on the account, and pay back the AMEX bill. If you'd like, you can even compensate your trusted friend with a fraction of the interest, or you two can be counterparties for each other in this scheme!

This can even be automated with automatic payments to AMEX from the savings account in question - the only thing that cannot be automated is the venmo to and from your counterparty.

That being said - is there any reason this is not a feasible strategy? The only risks I can see are 

1. opportunity cost - the profit from such a strategy is on the order of cents or single dollars per month. You might as well use your time to do something actualy useful :)
2. Mismatching cash flows so that you miss a credit card payment and get hit with interest (which will probably wipe out your profits lol), but if setup properly this should never happen.",1,AMEX Venmo Arbitrage - Thoughts?

Adding to the sense of weakness in the data, industrial output  in August was revised to a fall of 0.1% versus the prior estimate of a  0.4% gain. 

Capacity utilization fell to 75.2% in September, the  lowest rate since April.

This is the biggest decline since February, when Winter Storm Uri  wreaked havoc in Texas. Manufacturing had been a bright spot even though  the sector is struggling with supply bottlenecks. 

Some  of the weakness was due to Hurricane Ida. The hurricane cut about 0.6  percentage points from the drop in total industrial production, the Fed  said.

 Output at manufacturers fell  0.7% in September, led by a 7.2% drop in production of motor vehicles  and parts. Excluding the auto sector, manufacturing was down 0.3%.

paulrudder,"Curious to hear everyone's thoughts on this. Barclay's apparently downgraded Disney today due to slowed growth of Disney+ this past quarter and the shares have taken a small tumble as a result.

I own a handful of shares since first purchasing this year, and was planning to continue buying and hodling long term just because it seems like a no-brainer of a company to invest in and I was also looking at their future pipeline in terms of the theme parks reopening and their Marvel/Star Wars etc. properties and acquisition of Fox. 

By the same token, since it's a major blue chip stock and already has a massive market cap, I'm not really sure if it even makes sense to buy as a single stock or if I should just invest the money into index funds that would naturally have Disney holdings and might have higher annual returns...?

I do already hold S&amp;P stocks and my 401k is heavily comprised of a Fidelity SP500 stock, so that's why I'm hesitant to not diversify somewhat more.

Quahl is an attempt by ex-PayPal guys to create a new payment system instead of payment cards that were designed in the 1950s. The system uses its own currency, the quahl, and to get people to start using the system once it's ready they are allocating quahls for free to people that sign up now (the amount drops as more people join - so better to join early). Signing up is free and they only ask for your name and an email address. There's nothing to lose but if this payment system becomes a world leading payment method your quahls can be worth a lot. If you missed getting bitcoin seven years ago, you wouldn't want to miss this.

Most-Ad7385,"With all that’s been going on, it makes me contemplate if investing in it is still a good idea. Just recently state miner Codelco’s copper production for the month of August took a dip, going down by 6.7% year-on-year to 144,500 tonnes due to a strike in one of their mines. BHP, another big company, showed a drop in their copper production as well because their Escondida mine has issues in operation due to the imposed restriction caused by the coronavirus pandemic. Chile is the top producer in the world when it comes to copper, so the production getting affected is a big deal.

Another issue is also the problem with property giant China Evergrande Group. The company encountered a debt crisis that caused copper prices to fall, fueling worries about the demand for the metal. The price touched at $4.090 per pound ($8,998 per tonne) on the Comex market in New York. Though it seemed to have bounced back recently after they announced a deal over a $35.9 million bond interest payment.

Because of all these. I’m contemplating if it’s still smart to invest in it. I’ve been looking into some recently. I got my eyes on bigger ones like BHP and FCX (especially this one, I heard a lot of good things about it). I feel like it is safer to invest in these since they are already big producers.

I’m also looking into some juniors though because of the return I might get despite the risks of investing in it. I’m also prioritizing diversifying my portfolio.

Progenity, Inc. engages in the provision of molecular and specialized diagnostic tests to clinicians. Its products include Preparent Carrier Test, Innatal Prenatal Screen, Riscover Hereditary Cancer Test, and Resura Prenatal Test. 

Case for Short-Squeeze

1. Prog has one of the highest SI (about 64%) while only one entity is trying to keep the price suppressed (Athyrium).

2. CTB continues to rise everyday as per Ortex data

3. Ortex has issued all 3 signals of short-squeeze on Prog

4. It’s a penny stock at a price that anyone who is in stock market investing can easily buy and hold to add to buying pressure.

5. Price jump from 0.88 to 2.5 brought in a lot of 0.5, 1, and 1.5 calls option ITM for 10/15

6. The company shorting it doesn’t have unlimited money supply to keep the price suppressed unlike a hedgefund that can/does divert all their money to control any stock they want.

7. **Catalysts:** Prog already got a patient approved October 5th but no PR because of the Athyium manipulation below (personal opinion).

a. **Evidence (**[**Look at the date of recent patent**](https://patents.justia.com/assignee/progenity-inc)**)**

8. **No unlimited money for Athyrium to short:** Athyrium isn’t in core business of shorting to make money and continue to do until they win. This factor alone along with buying pressure will force them to wave white flag within days-not weeks.

**Why Athyrium is shorting is and is in trouble now.**

1. Athyrium has a pattern of suppressing price to buy low as many shares as they can to take control of the company and then sell at a premium ([Evidence](https://www.athyrium.com/case-study-verenium.php))

2. However, this time around Athyrium gets caught with Prog where retail picked this stock and brought into light of short-squeeze play.

3. Shorting means that this insider has to cover its short position eventually and they don’t have enough time and only hope is more share issue which is not happening until November 20th and actually may not even happen if squeeze happens before end of October. 

4. They hoped that retail eye won’t catch prog and hence they can cover  lower when the time comes

5. **Evidence of Athyrium manipulation: (**[**https://www.athyrium.com/case-study-verenium.php**](https://www.athyrium.com/case-study-verenium.php)**).** This article clearly shows that Athyrium is not new to this and was able to do this before, only difference is that Prog got retail attention making it difficult to manipulate easily. 

**a.** **Barcoding:**  The price is experiencing barcoding last whole week where it moves by 10 cents and then whole day is a move of max 4-5 cents each day. This is their tactic to continue buying lower to accumulate and hope retail pressure doesn’t come in.

**b.** **Way to break barcoding:**  With enough volume in even 1 day, tables will be turned and any price above $2.5 in coming week gives majority control to retail to make squeeze happen.

**Scenario 1 of Short Squeeze.**

**1.** With enough volume (500 Mil to a billion), the play will be totally out of Athyrium’s hands because it can lead to a price range of $2.40-$3.25 hopefully this coming week.

**2.** This will force Athyrium to cover its position and trigger a gamma-squeeze effect prior to 10/15.

**Scenario 2 of Short Squeeze.**

**1.** Continuing with first scenario, the price will be in $5 and above range in following week of 10/15

**2.** Buyout option is still on the table which means Prog can never be sold under $5 and price decided for buyout is $8-$10 so every retail investor makes money while Athyrium goes home defeated with their lesser shares and whatever price.

**Scenario 3 of Short Squeeze.**

**1.** The buying pressure from scenario 3 continues leading the prog price in high double digits, leading to no share issue possibility at all and buyout still happens which means still atleastt 50%-70% premium on that price (Let’s say $25 + 50%-70%).

**Scenario 4 of Short Squeeze (Least desirable for retail investors).**

**1.** Athyirum continues to do its shit plan and keeps price down before buyout. They will cover at lower cost and everyone holding shares makes just good enough profit at $4 price buyout.

**How to make squeeze happen:**

1. Significant ITM calls buy volume for those who love option play.

2. One day of 300-500 Mil in volume with buying pressure to just start the squeeze this week

**P.S:** It is up by 64% which is still nothing in comparison to upward potential it has",1,$PROG Why it’s the easiest Short-squeeze with atleast high double-digit upward potential (Insider backstabbing by Athyrium)- Its still the highest shorted stock with a lot of catalysts happening
Che74,"Prefaced from Bloomberg Opinion:

Flooding in the coal hub of Shanxi province have driven prices up to $234 a metric ton as the government tries to kickstart extra production, further measures are needed to prevent more generators cutting off their turbines and causing blackouts through northern China’s winter. That means a crackdown on the factories that still consume the majority of electricity.  Industry makes up 25% of grid demand in the U.S., in China it’s 59%  — more than all the country’s homes, offices and retail stores put together. Cheap power has been essential for development in China. The problem now is that coal is very expensive. That’s where renewables come in. At the same time that price curbs are being removed from industries, capacity curbs are being lifted from zero-carbon power generation. With zero-carbon electricity already cheaper than most existing operating coal power plants, those changes may be just the spur to wean China from solid fuels.

(Bloomberg) -- Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta President Raphael Bostic said this year’s inflation surge is lasting longer than policymakers expected, so it’s not appropriate to refer to such price increases as transitory. 

“Transitory is a dirty word,” Bostic said in a virtual speech to the Peterson Institute for International Economics on Tuesday. He spoke with a glass jar labeled “transitory” at his side, depositing $1 each time he used the “swear word,” as it’s become known to him and his staff over the past few months. 

“It is becoming increasingly clear that the feature of this episode that has animated price pressures — mainly the intense and widespread supply-chain disruptions — will not be brief,” Bostic said. “By this definition, then, the forces are not transitory.”

Bostic, who votes on monetary policy this year, endorsed the Federal Open Market Committee’s plans to taper its $120 billion in monthly asset purchases, which is likely to start at its November meeting. In a Q&amp;A with Peterson President Adam Posen, Bostic said U.S. growth and the recovery in employment have exceeded his expectations.

“I’ve adjusted my ‘dot plot’ submissions to reflect much greater growth, much more in terms of jobs and also higher inflation,” Bostic said, referring to the committee’s quarterly interest rate forecasts. “It’s also called me to pull forward some of my thinking about when interest rate liftoff will be. That’s still more than a year off in my forecasts.”

Tapering is unlikely to slow the economy because markets are functioning well and the issues with the U.S. economy are more about supply-chain disruptions from Covid-19 rather than demand, he said in the Q&amp;A.

Bostic’s concern with inflation was echoed by St. Louis Fed President James Bullard, who said he favors starting to taper in November and finishing by the first quarter of 2022 to give the central bank flexibility to raise rates if necessary.

“The story that inflation will come down naturally is a reasonable one, but I only want to put 50% probability on that scenario,” Bullard said Tuesday in a televised interview with CNBC. “I have got to put some probability on a scenario where inflation stays high or even goes higher.”

In his prepared remarks, Bostic said he was seeing signs of a broadening in inflation.

“I believe evidence is mounting that price pressures have broadened beyond the handful of items most directly connected to supply-chain issues or the reopening of the services sector,” he said.

He said longer-run inflation expectations measures have climbed, with many reaching decade highs.

“These upside risks to the inflation outlook bear watching closely,” Bostic said. “Up to now, indicators do not suggest that long-run inflation expectations are dangerously untethered. But the episodic pressures could grind on long enough to unanchor expectations. We will be watching carefully.”

mjbauer95,"I'm trying to weight by market capitalization in my portfolio to ""build my own"" index where I hold some particular stocks but also some index funds. To accomplish this, I want to know what the ""exposed"" market cap of a particular ETF in a way that is comparable to individual stocks. That is, I don't want the number to be based on how much money is in the particular ETF, but based on the value of the underlying index.

For my use case, I am looking at VSS - Vanguard's FTSE All World ex US Small Cap ETF. The ""quoted"" market cap right now for VSS is $11.6 billion, but this is what the value of the fund, not its underlying assets.

Right now, to calculate this, I'm doing this, time consuming process each day:

* find the top holding of the ETF and its % of funds
* look up the market cap of the holding
* divide the market cap of the holding by the percent of funds

For example, for VSS, the largest holding is WSP Global Inc. @ 0.41% of funds. WSP Global Inc.'s market cap is $19.15 billion. So, VSS's ""exposed"" market cap is $19.15 billion / 0.41% = $4.67 trillion, which is much more than $11.6 billion.

Does anyone know the term for what I'm wanting? All of my searches give the $11.6 billion market cap.",1,"How to calculate ""exposed"" market cap in ETF?"

In comparing them to the mutual fund FBGRX, it looks like the percentage returns are significantly lower then FBGRX.

U.S. consumer prices matched a 30-year high in September with 5.4% year-over-year growth.

That makes sense. The COVID-19 pandemic, and the policy response of lockdowns and government stimulus, unleashed a massive switch in spending from services to goods. Spending on U.S. durable goods, in March, was 26% above its pre-pandemic trend.

“Suffice to say, a 26% excess demand for durable goods cannot be satisfied by a modern manufacturing sector that utilizes just-in-time supply chains and negligible spare capacity! As surging demand met relatively fixed supply, the price of durable goods skyrocketed to the current 11% above its pre-pandemic trend,” said Dhaval Joshi, chief strategist of BCA Research’s Counterpoint.

The surprise however has been the stickiness of services prices. That, Joshi explained, is because it wasn’t a classic demand shock. There was no point in services companies reducing prices because their customers couldn’t get those services anyway. “Meanwhile, statisticians continued to record the seemingly unaffected price of eating out or going to the theater, even though most restaurants and entertainment venues were shut,” he said.

There’s one notable country that didn’t mandate shutdowns or lockdowns — Sweden. And there, services prices did decline. And now, inflation in Sweden is about 3 percentage points less than in the U.S.

What the Swedish experience suggests is that prices will eventually stabilize. “The surging demand for durables is correcting. Since March, it is already down by 15% but requires a further 7% decline to reach its pre-pandemic trend, which we fully expect to happen. After all, there are only so many smartphones and used cars that you can own,” Joshi said.

As for services, there are two forces — the wage rises as a result of the rocketing price of goods, but the deflationary force of hybrid home and office working, which will make it difficult for services spending to reach its pre-pandemic trending.",1,Inflation remains transitory. The Swedish experience tells us at least that much.

OfficerCHODEMAN,"Hi guys, lucky for me, GWH came onto my radar two weeks ago when I was looking into the plans for Sun Cable, an Australian plan to provide up to 15% of Singapores daily electricity needs via massive solar farms and an undersea cable.

The main challenge with renewables at the moment is battery storage. Renewables are now the cheapest power source available but face massive constraints in the form of consistent supply and grid smoothing. Lithium ion mega storages are currently the answer but have many drawbacks. High fire risk, 4 hour max storage, fast degradation, high price, environmentally damaging disposal and need for cooling.

Enter ESS storage ($GWH) an iron flow battery made of Iron and electrolytes and salt water. Iron flow batteriy is a type of electrochemical cell where chemical energy is provided by two chemical components dissolved in liquids that are pumped through the system on separate sides of a membrane.\[2\]\[3\] Ion exchange (accompanied by flow of electric current) occurs through the membrane while both liquids circulate in their own respective space. (wikipedia)

ESS could be the future for renewable storage and billionaire backers like Bill Gates are all over the future tech ([https://www.cnbc.com/2021/10/11/ess-battery-company-backed-by-bill-gates-softbank-opens-on-nyse.html](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/10/11/ess-battery-company-backed-by-bill-gates-softbank-opens-on-nyse.html)). It has a very reasonable 70% round trip efficiency, meaning it loses 30% of the power you put into it.

ESS has a few advantages over lithium ion; No need for cooling so can be used in hot environments like Texas, Australia, California. Extremely cheap source materials. Storage up to 10 hours. 20,000 cycle life and NO storage degradation versus 5000 cycle life for lithium ion.

The downside I can see for this stock are new battery techs stealing market share. Slow adoption of renewables. Or potentially extreme price drop in lithium ion cost, tech or safety.

I am long on this stock

Something curious I noticed this morning is GHW had a high short borrow fee (130%) whilst there are only 4.3 million shares available for public trading due to 180 day lockup([https://www.reddit.com/r/SPACs/comments/q6c8gl/gwh\_ess\_tech\_backed\_by\_bill\_gates\_and\_me\_started/](https://www.reddit.com/r/SPACs/comments/q6c8gl/gwh_ess_tech_backed_by_bill_gates_and_me_started/)). GWH has already squeezed once. The reason GWH squeezed initially is because a lot of people are shorting SPACs as they have fallen out of favour to investors recently AND GWH had a high redemption of shares (bailing out of the SPAC)

Jefferies cited several reasons behind its update on TSLA stock, though the analyst noted that part of it is due to the growing gap between Tesla and legacy OEMs. 

“We raise EBIT estimates 7-9% for 2022-23 and PT to $950 on higher capacity ramp and sustained demand, following further analysis of Q3 data and various sources of information on the soon-to-be-launched Berlin facility. For some time, the narrative has been legacy OEMs closing the gap; we see little evidence as Tesla continues to challenge at multiple levels.

Infinera settled before going to trial, but the lawyers secured me an incentive award from the courts as part of the settlement, as compensation for being a lead plaintiff. I was honestly expecting to get like 15 bucks thrown my way if there was a settlement - over the years I've received several settlement awards, a few for $100 or $200 but the vast majority end up being &lt;$25, and I've never been lead plaintiff before and didn't have any idea what to expect - so I was completely surprised when **they sent me a $1,000 check!!** 

I can't stress enough how little effort was required on my part. I signed an agreement to let them represent me, sent them redacted PDF copy of my brokerage statement to confirm I owned the shares during the settlement period, and sent maybe 3 one-sentence emails over a period of about 3 months authorizing them to take each of steps they advised taking on my behalf.

How I see it, the macro-environment is really stacked against crypto-mining stocks AFTER the current bull run is over. Bitcoin usually takes 1-2 years to decline to a new low (this time a good estimate is probably 75% from ATH); interest rates are likely to go up in the next 1-2 years making the debt these companies have more difficult to service; and most importantly, these stocks are momentum-driven, when investors realize the bull run is over I think many will not want to wait years to see new highs.

X-2357,"IONq is the first of many world changing quantum computer companies. Rigetti uses traditional superconducting quantum arrays that translate a little easier to conventional computers. The huge downside is the need for extreme cooling. Rigetti uses multi layers where the innermost layer is 100x colder than outerspace. Xanadu uses photonic systems that are great, and run at room temp but they need lots of additional hardware to work and will be difficult to scale down. Microsoft is working on topological arrays which would provide utility benefits but it hasn't been proven yet and they had to retract one of their papers on it. The point is that there are various methods to how you can create and manipulate qubits, the foundation for quantum computing.

IONq uses trapped ions, from a single atom of ytterbium. Technically a rare metal but it's not rare. Then they manipulate the ions using lasers to create the qubits on the array. Sh*t is bleeding edge and I understand .005% of it but I read everything I can find. It can run at room temp and be easily scaled. Basically IONq doesn't need all the extra resources to create and manipulate their qubits, so the cost and energy requirements are down. This also allows for upscaling arrays on existing hardware. Like they can turn a 16 qubit system into a 64 qubit system eventually using the same stuff  they just have to reduce the expected errors that come with quantum computing.

IONq got starting investment money from Amazon, Bill Gates, Samsung, Lockheed Martin, Hyundai, goldman sachs and more. They used that money to prove the tech works and are currently operating with Amazon Braket as their most powerful hardware supplier. Currently IONq has the most powerful quantum computer in business operation at 32 qubits. The next closest comp is 16 qubits. And you can have 9 qubit, 11 qubits computers, it doesn't need to be doubled evenly like ram for instance.

Remember when you see qubit numbers in the future and from other companies, what that really means.

Quantum computing is based on ""physical qubits"" and ""digital"" simulated qubits. Conventional computers use bits.

No matter what method you use, ions, photonic, superconducting, etc, You can't have a fully isolated qubit because then you couldn't interact with it to manipulate and tell it what to do. To get around this, modern quantum computing is based on running ""leaking"" environments with varying fidelity and trackable errors. We use the say 93% that is still functional to simulate more isolated qubits, and use those to simulate even more isolated qubits, in deeper layers until we have a fully isolated qubit we can error correct. 

Eventually we need 1 million qubit machines to simulate 10k error corrected machines. IONq just demonstrated how they can scale up to a million at a recent presentation. Eventually a QPU could really lead to some radically advancements in financial predictions, cybersecurity and encryption, biotech discovery, simulation modeling and on and on.

They SPAC merged with DMYI with $600m , $350m of which is pipe investment that is locked up for 6 months from now. Ran to $12 before merger, tanked to $10 at merger, tanked to $7.30 during spy correction and tech sell off. It was mostly shorts based on volume. They have tiny revenue because they are just getting started but that doesn't matter imo. They had that white house presentation to show off and IONq is the only pure quantum computer company on the market so far, with rigetti spac io'ing in a few months.

The pipe investment unlocks in 5 1/2 months and that could be the only negative event coming up. I'll decide what I do with my shares, closer to the date, either hold or sell then compound my gains to hold, maybe for life. It's bleeding edge tech and to try to simplify it more, instead of linear binary data, 1s and 0s. The data can be 1 and 0 at the same time in any ratio, in any direction. It's a bigger technological leap than people understand.

The FDA said data indicates the first two doses of the Moderna vaccine still provide protection against severe disease and death.  
   
The staff said the third dose increased the antibody response sufficiently, one endpoint of the study. The extra dose, however, narrowly missed meeting the other study endpoint, of increasing antibody levels by a large magnitude and in a high enough percentage of study subjects.

&gt; HONG KONG - China Evergrande Group on Tuesday missed its third round of bond payments in three weeks, intensifying market fears over contagion involving other property developers as a wall of debt payment obligations come due in the near-term.
Some bondholders said they did not receive coupon payments totalling US$148 million on Evergrande's April 2022, April 2023 and April 2024 notes due by 0400 GMT on Tuesday, following two other payments it missed in September.

TrumpsThirdTesticle," 

I'm aware many despise AT&amp;T - this is an objective view - not saying buy/hold/sell, just want to discuss.

Current Share Price = $25.42 / Current Dividend = 8.81% / Annual Dividend = $2.08.

Projected dividend after the Warner bros/Disc deal = $1.11 per share annualized.

Projected yield after the merger at current price = 4.4%.

Assuming the following:

* 7.1 billion AT&amp;T shares on issue
* Value of Warner bros Discovery 120 bil (High), 100 bil (mid), 80 bil (low) and 60 bil (conservative)
* T shareholders get 70% of shares in new company
* Dividend after merger cut to $1.11 per share

With the following calculation:

(value of new company \* 70%) / 7.1 billion shares on issue = Value of new company per AT&amp;T share

So...

1. (120 billion \* 70%) / 7.1billion = $11.83 per share (High value)
2. (100 billion \* 70%) / 7.1billion = $9.85 per share (Mid value)
3. (80 billion \* 70%) / 7.1 billiion = $7.88 per share (Low value)
4. (60 billion \* 70%) / 7.1 billiion = $5.91 per share (Conservative value)

So... at the current valuation assuming no price change after merget

1. High value = $37.25 ($11.83 per share of warner disc + AT&amp;T 25.43)
2. Mid Value = $35.27
3. Low Value = $33.3
4. Conservative Value= $31.00

Extra scenario 1 - assume that AT&amp;T price drops to maintain a dividend yield of at least 6% (to be 1% higher than near competitor Verizon which has a safer dividend... = T Share price of $18.5

1. High value = $30.33 ($11.83 per share of warner disc + AT&amp;T $18.5)
2. Mid Value = $28.35
3. Low Value = $26.38
4. Conservative Value= $24.41

Extra scenario 2 - assume that AT&amp;T price drops to maintain a dividend yield of at least 7% (restored to the beloved 7%) = T Share price of $15.85

1. High value = $27.68 ($11.83 per share of warner disc + AT&amp;T $15.85)
2. Mid Value = $25.7
3. Low Value = $23.78
4. Conservative Value= $21.76

This is Rollercoin which is over 3 years old now. In fact, the game is all about virtually mining bitcoin, ethereum, or doge. But, although the game is virtual, you still earn bitcoins.

Basically, the idea is that every 5 minutes or so (depending on the hash powers), players receive the rewards for resolving a block in the blokchain. The rewards are even stronger than the miner at high power.

Yes, it works the same as bitcoin mining in “real life” (oh yeah). So it works as if you had to run a mining farm. That is, you will have to manage the electricity, your rigs, your installations etc.

To create Mining Power, you will need to play games. The more you play, the higher your power and therefore the more you win. It is by playing the various games in RollerCoin that you ""mine"" bitcoin (or etherum, doge). The more you play, the more you win.

You can also mine the site's crypto which is the rollertoken to buy miners. You can convert everything to rollertokens by the way.

But now once i try to follow one i get distracted from the other setups and try to include them in which makes it way harder. And i catched an OCD where i won't take a trade until it's a pin bar.

And i use pivots and Central Pivot Range in my Trade.

&gt;While major stock market indices are followed by large monetary investments, we document that 
membership decisions  for  the  S&amp;P  500  index  have  a  nontrivial  amount  of  discretion.  We  show that  firms’  purchases of  S&amp;P  ratings  appear  to  improve  their  chance  of  entering  the  index  (but purchases  of  Moody’s  ratings do  not).  Furthermore,  firms  tend  to  purchase  more  S&amp;P  ratings when there are openings in the index membership. Such a pattern is also confirmed by an event study that explores a rule change on index membership in 2002. Finally, discretionary additions exhibit subsequent deterioration in financial performance relative to rule-based additions.

That ruling would let app businesses circumvent Apple’s requirement to facilitate payments only inside of apps, where Apple takes up to a 30% cut. Apple is also appealing the ruling.**  
&gt;  
&gt;**Because Epic Games is also appealing the nine counts it lost, it could take years before the case is resolved and Apple is forced to make any changes to iOS, the operating system for iPhones, as the two companies wrangle through the appeals process in court.**   
&gt;  
&gt;**The judge is expected to rule on Apple’s request for a stay next month.**  
&gt;  
&gt;Apple’s move is a surprising turnaround from its tone following the decision in September. While Apple always left open the possibility of an appeal, it portrayed the judge’s ruling as a resounding legal win for its App Store business model, which has come under fire from technology rivals, international regulators and members of the U.S. Congress.  
&gt;  
&gt;“We are very pleased with the Court’s ruling and we consider this a huge win for Apple,” Kate Adams, Apple’s lawyer, said in September following the ruling.  
&gt;  
&gt;The Friday night announcement inspired a torrent of commentary from Apple critics. They pointed out the move would preserve Apple’s App Store profits by preventing apps from using alternative payment systems. One company announced last week that it was already working on a [cheaper, web-based alternative to Apple’s app payments](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/10/07/developers-building-ways-to-skirt-apples-cut-of-in-app-purchases.html) \-- a move made possible only by the ruling that Apple is now appealing.

&gt;  
&gt;**Apple said it filed the appeal now because it faces a legal deadline this month. If Apple didn’t appeal now, it would forever lose the option, and it can always change its mind and withdraw the appeal. Apple also framed its appeal as a way to hold off a hasty business decision before the case is fully closed. The current order from the judge requires Apple to allow apps to link out to the web in December.**  
&gt;  
&gt;If the judge grants Apple the stay on the order next month, then the status quo will remain until Epic Games and Apple settle their beef. That could take years and help Apple resist more forced changes to its App Store model.

&gt;In the meantime though, there are plenty of other external legal threats to Apple’s App Store. For example, a bipartisan bill in the in the Senate would [force Apple to accept alternative in-app payments](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/08/11/bipartisan-bill-targets-apple-and-googles-ability-to-profit-from-app-stores.html).

(The Japanese order does not apply to games, which is where most believe Apple makes the largest amount of App Store profit.)

Chocowarrior,"Hello,

Is there a portfolio manager that track multiple currencies and calculate cost basis automatically?

I'm from Australia and trade ASX and NYSE shares. When i deposit AUD into my international brokers it charges me fees/crappier rates. Then i buy the shares i want in USD. I want the app to track how ive spent on those shares or track how much initial money were lost to fees/crap rates.

E.g. Deposit $10,000 AUD, receive 7000 USD (instead of 7500) (example rate). Buy share 70 shares of XX at $100/share. Price per share broker tell me is $100/share which totals $7000US when in reality i spent $10,000 or $7500. So my actual share price was $107.14/share.

Okmanl,"""While leveraged purchases of stock increase short-term risk, it reduces long-term risk by letting individuals achieve better diversification across time.

Using stock data going back to 1871, we show that buying stock on margin when young combined with more conservative investments when older stochastically dominates standard investment strategies—both traditional life-cycle investments and 100%-stock investments.

The expected retirement wealth is 84% higher compared to life-cycle funds and 20% higher compared to 100% stock investments. Relative to traditional life-cycle investments, the expected gain from this improved asset allocation would allow workers to retire 9 years earlier or extend their standard of living during retirement for an additional 20 years. For a worker with CRRA=2, the increased retirement consumption raises lifetime utility by 7.3%. The potential gains are substantial...

We recognize that our recommendation to begin with leverage positions goes against conventional advice. And yet, our recommendation flows directly from the basic Samuelson and Merton lifecycle savings model. It is also supported by the data. We will 2 show that following this advice leads to higher returns with lower risks. This is true both for historical data and for a variety of Monte Carlo simulations.""

Quite an interesting paper, basically it says if you're young, leveraging actually decreases risk. \*Because you're diversifying across time\*. Most people have too much invested when old, and too little invested in stocks when young.

LeMondain,"In recent years there’s been a change in the way investors, economists and officials think about public borrowing. They’ve become less interested in the debt’s size, and more focused on what it costs. With occasional hops and bounces, [30 years treasury yields](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/%5ETYX?p=%5ETYX) have been on a pretty steady decline since 1985, which makes borrowing ever-cheaper. 

Treasury secretary Yellen said that even though the amount of debt relative to the economy has risen, the interest burden - the amount the Treasury pays to service its debt - has not, due to lower interest rates.

[If it were possible to take interest rates into negative territory I would be voting for that.](https://www.azquotes.com/quote/711345) \- Janet Yellen, ""Why Gold Is Unstoppable"" by Doug French, [www.caseyresearch.com](https://www.caseyresearch.com). March 19, 2014.

On the other hand, Michael Burry is betting that interest rates are about to go up.

Let's assume FED raises interest rates, that brings up the question: How are we gonna service the debt if borrowing costs get increasingly more expensive? It seems like a debt death spiral - the more expensive borrowing is, the more debt you need to take to service it.

A lot of observations contribute to this feeling too.

- shortages due to a lack of appreciation or value for non-monetary contributions in the workplace
- shortages due to lack of proper healthcare
- shipping labor shortages due to people not wanting to commit to another year at sea with no shore leave, because pandemic
- shortages of supplies all over the place (chips, silicon, etc)

lowbreadth39,"On September 21, the Canadian market rallied after the re-election of Prime Minister Justin Trudeau's Liberals Party with the assurance that Canada’s economy would keep improving. Economic and regulatory environments have a huge influence on an economy’s performance because government policies hugely affect business operations. Investors should decide their investment strategies depending on how these government policies impact each industry and its elements.


Fiscal policy under Trudeau's Liberals Party is expected to remain loose, thus promoting businesses in general. The financial sector and renewable energy sector would have the maximum impact as the government is likely to impose a 3% tax on large banks and insurers, and might also remove fossil fuel subsidies within two years to reach a zero-emission target by 2050. Furthermore, the telecommunications industry might also witness some reforms as the government is eager to establish affordable and consumer-friendly internet and cellphone plans.

ButtBlock,"Was thinking tonight about how real estate has continued to become more and more expensive, (i.e. a good investment) over the past 70 years. However that price run up has been predicated both on the largest population explosion in human history, as well as artificial construction of supply, by NIMBYs and zoning laws in many parts of the world. 

I’ve always assumed that, aside from occasional collapses, real estate will continue to drift upwards, perhaps not a great investment compared to other assets, but better than inflation. 

The possibility exists of long term reversal of both of these supporting trends. Zoning laws are becoming threatened due to political backlash from how unaffordable housing has become. At the same time life in general has become so unaffordable that fertility rates are now strongly below replacement values in most of the developed world. 

Can’t say anything with any certainty of course, but I think a future of continued growth of housing prices for the next century isn’t a guarantee. Sounds obvious when I write it out, but psychologically I had a deep seated assumption that the housing market was a guaranteed success long term.  Think that may require a rethink. 

If population trends down in the developed world, that’s a possible future to consider when choosing investments. Fewer people could depress real prices of stocks in general.  Kind of difficult to know what types of companies would perform well in this scenario. I suppose technology companies specializing in automation (AI and robotics) is the only market I can think of that would do well. Commodities, construction, non-durables, energy, all of those seem to be at risk from a general long-term decline in population and therefore in aggregate demand.

While we all knew tech has outperformed significantly over the past 20 years, how much its outperformed is kind of nuts.


So much so, that a 65 / 35  QQQ - Bonds Portfolio yielded higher total and risk-adjusted returns than the S&amp;P!!

SPY (100):
Final Balance: $317,894
Best year + 32.2%
Worst year -  36.8%
Sharpe - 0.64


Whats mind blowing is this is with regular quarterly rebalancing, throwing 35% of your recurring investment into bonds every quarter (where intuitively, one would likely want to roll bond allocation into more equity during significant downturns). Which is to suggest returns could be even higher with the most basic concept of market timing (i.e., investing 90/10 into qqq in midst of 08 financial crisis). Im not talking about plucking tops and bottoms with any serious level of precision.



Why is S&amp;P still the gold standard? How many decades does tech need to outperform before people acknowledge its here to stay and will only grow? We have millenials raised on tech now becoming the largest income earners. People have been waiting for tech to ""correct"" itself again for two decades, and lost out on significant return for a perceived benefit of diversification, when the reality is that even at 65/35 QQQ  you not only beat the S&amp;P but do so with definitively less risk as measured by sharpe &amp; drawdowns.

xNyxx,"Hi,

I'm trying to calculate the portfolio variance of a nat gas portfolio. Where I'm struggling is using the NYMEX forwards with a basis price (e.g. Chicago). Need help calculating the VAR if two legs of an asset make up the weighting of one asset in a portfolio. For example: In layman's terms, the Chicago physical forward pricing is the NYMEX + the Chicago basis, which will together make up one asset in the physical gas portfolio. Can I just add the two legs together and consider this as one price, because I don't intend to have one without the other? Say my second asset is the NYMEX + Michigan Basis and I do the same thing to get a Michigan price. The covariance would account for the underlying NYMEX in both assets, correct?",1,Need help calculating portfolio variance of commodities portfolio

LONDON (Reuters) -  Investment bank JPMorgan has estimated that troubled Chinese property  giant Evergrande and many of its major rivals have billions of dollars  worth of off-balance sheet debt that, once added on, ramp up their  leverage ratios.

JPMorgan's China and Hong Kong property analysts  said the tactic is likely to have been used to help firms look like they  were conforming with new borrowing cap rules introduced last year, but  Evergrande's case looks the most extreme.

""Instead  of true deleveraging, we think Evergrande has shifted some of the  interest-bearing debt to off-balance sheet debt,"" JPMorgan's analysts  said. ""Commercial papers, wealth management products and perpetual  capital securities, etc, which are not officially counted as debt.""

They  estimated Evergrande's ""net gearing,"" as debt as a ratio of a firm's  equity is known, was at least 177% at the end of the first half of the  year, instead of the 100% its accounts reported.

""It is possible  that the real gearing could be even higher, as data on some off-balance  sheet debt is not publicly available,"" JPMorgan added, saying the  ""disguised"" debt as it called it added up to 55% of Evergrande's overall  debt.

Other major firms whose gearing levels were likely to be  higher than formally reported included R&amp;F Properties at 139% versus  the 123%, Sunac China Holdings at 138% versus 87% reported and Country  Garden at 76% versus 50% reported.

The U.S. economy created jobs at a much slower-than-expected pace in September, a pessimistic sign about the state of the economy though the total was held back substantially by a sharp drop in government employment.

Nonfarm payrolls rose by just 194,000 in the month, compared with the Dow Jones estimate of 500,000, the Labor Department reported Friday. The unemployment rate fell to 4.8%, better than the expectation for 5.1% and the lowest since February 2020.

The headline number was hurt by a 123,000 decline in government payrolls, while private payrolls increased by 317,000.

The drop in the jobless rate came as the labor force participation rate edged lower, meaning more people who were sidelined during the coronavirus pandemic have returned to the workforce. A more encompassing number that also includes so-called discouraged workers and those holding part-time jobs for economic reasons declined to 8.5%, also a pandemic-era low.

“This is quite a deflating report,” said Nick Bunker, economic research director at job placement site Indeed. “This year has been one of false dawns for the labor market. Demand for workers is strong and millions of people want to return to work, but employment growth has yet to find its footing.”

Nevertheless, markets reacted little to the news, with Dow futures around flat for the morning and government bond yields mixed as investors digested what was a mixed bag of a report.

Despite the weak jobs total, wages increased sharply. The monthly gain of 0.6% pushed the year-over-year rise to 4.6% as companies use wage increases to combat the persistent labor shortage. The available workforce declined by 183,000 in September and is 3.1 million shy of where it was in February 2020, just before the pandemic was declared.

“Labor shortages are continuing to put severe upward pressure on wages ... at a time when the return of low-wage leisure and hospitality workers should be depressing the average,” wrote Andrew Hunter, senior U.S. economist at Capital Economics.

Leisure and hospitality again led job creation, adding 74,000 positions, as the unemployment rate for the sector plunged to 7.7% from 9.1%. Professional and business services contributed 60,000 while retail increased by 56,000.

Job gains were spread across a variety of other sectors: Transportation and warehousing (47,000), information (32,000), social assistance (30,000), manufacturing (26,000), construction (22,000) and wholesale trade (17,000).

Local government education jobs fell by 144,000, which may have been due to seasonal adjustments in the numbers, according to Gus Faucher, chief economist at PNC.

The survey week of Sept. 12 came just as Covid cases were peaking in the U.S. The delta variant spread since has cooled, with cases most recently dropping below an average of 100,000 a day.

Unemployment for Blacks fell to 7.9% from 8.8%, due largely to a drop to 66% from 66.7% in the labor force participation rate for males.

There was some good news in Friday’s report from previous months.

July’s already-strong gains were revised higher by 38,000 to 1.0913 million, while August’s big letdown also was revised up, to 366,000 from the initially reported 235,000.

The employment-to-population level increased to 58.7%, its highest since March 2020.

The report comes at a critical time for the economy, with recent data showing solid consumer spending despite rising prices, growth in the manufacturing and services sector, and surging housing costs.

Federal Reserve officials are watching the jobs numbers closely. The central bank recently has indicated it’s ready to start pulling back on some of the extraordinary help it has provided during the pandemic crisis, primarily because inflation has met and exceeded the Fed’s 2% goal.

However, officials have said they see the jobs market still well short of full employment, a prerequisite for interest rate hikes. Market pricing currently indicates the first rate increase likely will come in November 2022.

“After looking like almost a done deal, today’s jobs number has thrown expectations for tapering into disarray. The Fed doesn’t seem to need much to convince it that tapering should begin imminently, but at just 194,000, jobs numbers are suggesting that the labor market is further from hitting the substantial progress goal than they expected,” said Seema Shah, chief strategist at Principal Global Investors.",1,"September’s jobs creation comes up short with gain of just 194,000 vs 500,000 expected"

stillness0072,"ChemoCentryx, Inc., (Nasdaq: CCXI), today announced that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved TAVNEOS (avacopan), an orally administered selective complement 5a receptor inhibitor, as an adjunctive treatment of adult patients with severe active anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic autoantibody-associated vasculitis (also known as ANCA-associated vasculitis or ANCA vasculitis), specifically granulomatosis with polyangiitis (GPA) and microscopic polyangiitis (MPA) (the two main forms of ANCA vasculitis), in combination with standard therapy. ANCA-associated vasculitis is a systemic autoimmune disease in which over-activation of the complement system further activates neutrophils, leading to inflammation and eventual destruction of small blood vessels. This results in organ damage and failure, with the kidney as the major target, and is often fatal if not treated.

\- ADVERTISEMENT -

“Today is a momentous day in the history of ChemoCentryx; the culmination of decades of effort aimed at offering new hope to patients with this and other debilitating and deadly diseases,” said Thomas J. Schall, Ph.D., President and Chief Executive Officer of ChemoCentryx. “We look forward to making TAVNEOS available to clinicians and patients in the next few weeks. We thank the Agency for their collaboration and consideration and we are also immensely grateful to the pioneering scientists, clinicians and patients who believed in the promise of TAVNEOS and who have worked tirelessly to make it a reality, along with my dedicated and talented colleagues at ChemoCentryx.”

“I am excited that our work has helped lead to the first-in-a-decade approval of a medicine for ANCA-associated vasculitis. This is an important step forward in the treatment of this disease,” said the trial’s co-primary academic investigator Peter A. Merkel, MD, MPH, the Chief of Rheumatology at the Perelman School of Medicine at the University of Pennsylvania, Director of the international Vasculitis Clinical Research Consortium, and consultant to ChemoCentryx. “Patients will now have access to a new class of medication that provides beneficial effects for the treatment of ANCA-associated vasculitis.”

“The vasculitis community is elated that TAVNEOS is now approved, bringing a much-needed new treatment option to patients living with this devastating disease,” said Joyce Kullman, Executive Director, Vasculitis Foundation. “There is a significant unmet need in the treatment of ANCA-associated vasculitis, with current therapies often leading to serious, even fatal, side effects and a diminished quality of life. We believe new therapies like TAVNEOS may offer a brighter future for these patients.”

TAVNEOS is the first FDA approved orally-administered inhibitor of the complement C5a receptor. The approval in ANCA-associated vasculitis was supported by the results of the pivotal Phase III ADVOCATE trial, which were highlighted in the February 2021 edition of *The New England Journal of Medicine (NEJM).* The ADVOCATE trial of TAVNEOS was a global, randomized, double-blind, active-controlled, double-dummy Phase III trial of 330 patients with ANCA-associated vasculitis in 20 countries. Eligible study subjects were randomized to receive either rituximab or cyclophosphamide (followed by azathioprine/mycophenolate) and either TAVNEOS (avacopan) or study-supplied oral prednisone. Subjects in both treatment groups could also receive non-protocol glucocorticoids if needed. The study met its primary endpoints of disease remission at 26 weeks and sustained remission at 52 weeks, as assessed by the Birmingham Vasculitis Activity Score, or BVAS. The study demonstrated superiority to a prednisone-based standard of care with respect to sustained remission at 52 weeks. The most common adverse reactions (≥5% of patients and higher in the TAVNEOS group vs. prednisone group) were: nausea, headache, hypertension, diarrhea, vomiting, rash, fatigue, upper abdominal pain, dizziness, blood creatinine increase, and paresthesia.

ChemoCentryx has developed TAVNEOS Connect, a patient support program designed to assist patients who are prescribed TAVNEOS. To learn more about TAVNEOS Connect, or TAVNEOS, visit www.TAVNEOS.com.

ChemoCentryx is responsible for the discovery and development of TAVNEOS (avacopan) and owns the commercial rights to the drug in the United States. ChemoCentryx's Kidney Health Alliance with Vifor Pharma provides Vifor Pharma with exclusive rights to commercialize TAVNEOS in markets outside of the U.S.

TAVNEOS (avacopan) is also approved for the treatment of microscopic polyangiitis and granulomatosis with polyangiitis (the two main forms of ANCA-associated vasculitis) in Japan. The regulatory decision in Europe following the European Medicines Agency (EMA) review is expected by the end of 2021.

**Conference Call and Webcast**  
ChemoCentryx will host a conference call and webcast today, October 8, 2021 at 8:30 a.m. Eastern Time / 5:30 a.m. Pacific Time. To participate by telephone, please dial (877) 303-8028 (Domestic) or (760) 536-5167 (International). The conference call ID number is 9576954.  The archived webcast will remain available on the Company’s website for fourteen (14) days following the conference call.

**INDICATION**  
TAVNEOS (avacopan) is indicated as an adjunctive treatment of adult patients with severe active anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic autoantibody (ANCA)-associated vasculitis (granulomatosis with polyangiitis \[GPA\] and microscopic polyangiitis \[MPA\]) in combination with standard therapy including glucocorticoids. TAVNEOS does not eliminate glucocorticoid use.

**IMPORTANT SAFETY INFORMATION**  


**CONTRAINDICATIONS**  
Serious hypersensitivity to avacopan or to any of the excipients

**WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS**  
Hepatotoxicity: Serious cases of hepatic injury have been observed in patients taking TAVNEOS, including life-threatening events. Obtain liver test panel before initiating TAVNEOS, every 4 weeks after start of therapy for six months and as clinically indicated thereafter. Monitor patients closely for hepatic adverse reactions, and consider pausing or discontinuing treatment as clinically indicated (refer to section 5.1 of the Prescribing Information). TAVNEOS is not recommended for patients with active, untreated and/or uncontrolled chronic liver disease (e.g., chronic active hepatitis B, untreated hepatitis C, uncontrolled autoimmune hepatitis) and cirrhosis. Consider the risk and benefit before administering this drug to a patient with liver disease.

Serious Hypersensitivity Reactions: Cases of angioedema occurred in a clinical trial, including one serious event requiring hospitalization. Discontinue immediately if angioedema occurs and manage accordingly. TAVNEOS must not be re-administered unless another cause has been established.

Hepatitis B Virus (HBV) Reactivation: Hepatitis B reactivation, including life threatening hepatitis B, was observed in the clinical program. Screen patients for HBV. For patients with evidence of prior infection, consult with physicians with expertise in HBV and monitor during TAVNEOS therapy and for six months following. If patients develop HBV reactivation, immediately discontinue TAVNEOS and concomitant therapies associated with HBV reactivation, and consult with experts before resuming.  


Serious Infections: Serious infections, including fatal infections, have been reported in patients receiving TAVNEOS. The most common serious infections reported in TAVNEOS group were pneumonia and urinary tract infections. Avoid use of TAVNEOS in patients with active, serious infection, including localized infections. Consider the risks and benefits before initiating TAVNEOS in patients with chronic infection, at increased risk of infection or who have been to places where certain infections are common.

**ADVERSE REACTIONS**  
The most common adverse reactions (≥5% of patients and higher in the TAVNEOS group vs. prednisone group) were: nausea, headache, hypertension, diarrhea, vomiting, rash, fatigue, upper abdominal pain, dizziness, blood creatinine increased, and paresthesia.

**DRUG INTERACTIONS**  
Avoid coadministration of TAVNEOS with strong and moderate CYP3A4 enzyme inducers. Reduce TAVNEOS dose when co-administered with strong CYP3A4 enzyme inhibitors to 30 mg once daily. Monitor for adverse reactions and consider dose reduction of certain sensitive CYP3A4 substrates.

**About** **TAVNEOS™** **(avacopan)**  
TAVNEOS (avacopan), approved by the FDA as an adjunctive treatment of ANCA-associated vasculitis, is a first-in-class, orally-administered small molecule that employs a novel, highly targeted mode of action in complement-driven autoimmune and inflammatory diseases. While the precise mechanism in ANCA vasculitis has not been definitively established, TAVNEOS, by blocking the complement 5a receptor (C5aR) for the pro-inflammatory complement system fragment known as C5a on destructive inflammatory cells such as blood neutrophils, is presumed to arrest the ability of those cells to do damage in response to C5a activation, which is known to be the driver of ANCA vasculitis. TAVNEOS’s selective inhibition of only the C5aR leaves the beneficial C5a pathway through the C5L2 receptor functioning normally.

ChemoCentryx is also developing TAVNEOS for the treatment of patients with C3 glomerulopathy (C3G), hidradenitis suppurativa (HS) and Lupus Nephritis (LN). The U.S. Food and Drug Administration granted TAVNEOS orphan drug designation for ANCA-associated vasculitis and C3G. The European Commission has granted orphan medicinal product designation for TAVNEOS for the treatment of two forms of ANCA-associated vasculitis: microscopic polyangiitis and granulomatosis with polyangiitis (formerly known as Wegener's granulomatosis), as well as for C3G.

**About ANCA-Associated Vasculitis**  
ANCA-associated vasculitis is a systemic disease in which over-activation of the complement pathway further activates neutrophils, leading to inflammation and destruction of small blood vessels. This results in organ damage and failure, with the kidney as the major target, and is fatal if not treated. Currently, treatment for ANCA-associated vasculitis consists of courses of non-specific immuno-suppressants (cyclophosphamide or rituximab), combined with the administration of daily glucocorticoids (steroids) for prolonged periods of time, which can be associated with significant clinical risk including death from infection.

**About ChemoCentryx**  
ChemoCentryx is a biopharmaceutical company commercializing and developing new medications for inflammatory and autoimmune diseases and cancer. ChemoCentryx targets the chemokine and chemoattractant systems to discover, develop and commercialize orally-administered therapies. In the United States, ChemoCentryx markets TAVNEOSTM (avacopan), the first approved orally-administered inhibitor of the complement 5a receptor as an adjunctive treatment for adult patients with severe active ANCA-associated vasculitis. TAVNEOS is also in late-stage clinical development for the treatment of severe Hidradenitis Suppurativa and C3 glomerulopathy (C3G). Additionally, ChemoCentryx has early-stage drug candidates that target chemoattractant receptors in other inflammatory and autoimmune diseases and in cancer.

**Introduction**: There has been a lot of discussion as to the increase in money supply and inflation. Most seem to think that an increase in M2 inevitably leads to inflation in prices of goods and services. This couldn't be further from the truth. There was previously a strong correlation between the two up until 1990. From then on, the correlation has reversed and is negative. There is now a much stronger relationship between increases in the money supply and decreases in the velocity of money, meaning that money is not moving through the economy as it once did. This means that increases in the money supply are not getting spent. And as we all know, money must be spent to cause inflation. This is why economists are not overly concerned about the recent rapid rise in the money supply causing inflation.

So here are the four easy charts:

1. This [first chart](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vQY4owBA5SP28Ng2glt_fG0jnDXTgwvsp-Q90VTA5_TTqrSZQRjkUTZeE1Zt5BOSxCnkHz-TX6HWu2z/pubchart?oid=809733064&amp;format=image) shows the correlation between the adjusted money supply and inflation. The M2 money supply is adjusted by subtracting real GDP. This amounts to the excess money beyond what is needed to grow real GDP. This has the strongest correlation with inflation. Inflation is measured by the implicit GDP price deflator, which measures the actual items that were spent in the year vs. a previous year's base price. You can use PCE or CPI, but the relationship is very similar. (Also I'm using an 8 year moving average because this gives the strongest correlation between the two variables. The correlation is very weak in concurrent periods, and gets a little stronger using 2 and 4 year moving averages.) You can see from this chart that the correlation was very strong from 1968, the first year of the 8 year moving average, through the end of 1990. R = 0.95 and R\^2 = 0.90. This indicates that 90% of changes in inflation can be explained by the changes in the adjusted money supply. This strong relationship has lead the general public to believe that the two variables are inherently related: That is, that the expansion of the adjusted money supply inevitably leads to inflation.
2. The [second chart](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vQY4owBA5SP28Ng2glt_fG0jnDXTgwvsp-Q90VTA5_TTqrSZQRjkUTZeE1Zt5BOSxCnkHz-TX6HWu2z/pubchart?oid=2061624488&amp;format=image) shows the correlation from 1991-2021. You can clearly see that the relationship reversed. R= -0.50 R\^2 = 0.25. This indicates that the rate of inflation decreases as the adjusted money supply increases. It shows a moderate to weak relationship in which the increase in the adjusted money supply explains about 25% of the decrease in the rate of inflation. This can probably be explained by the fact that the money supply has seen its largest increases in periods when the economy was in recession and prices were falling. Needless to say, you can see that the former relationship between these two variables does NOT exist anymore and hasn't for 30 years!
3. This [third chart](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vQlyD-2fO9g1W3h6VFXV_r-CJo5MdLourVfNF5HMo_uG-8s1Rpu2293GA-_3LkBGbF_WM0CkWI61zXx/pubchart?oid=997615969&amp;format=image) shows the relationship between changes in adjusted money supply and changes in the velocity of money from 1960-1990. The velocity of money is the frequency of monetary transactions in the economy. You can clearly see that the relationship is negative, as the adjusted money supply increases, the number of transactions decreases. R = -0.63 R\^2 = 0.40. This indicates that 40% of the decrease in the velocity of money can be explained by the increase in the adjusted money supply. This is a moderately strong relationship.
4. This [last chart](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vQlyD-2fO9g1W3h6VFXV_r-CJo5MdLourVfNF5HMo_uG-8s1Rpu2293GA-_3LkBGbF_WM0CkWI61zXx/pubchart?oid=946401508&amp;format=image) shows the correlation of adjusted money supply and the velocity of money from 1991-2021. R= -0.98 R\^2 = 0.97. This indicates the strengthening of the relationship between increases in adjusted money supply and decreases in the velocity of money. You can clearly see that the more money that is pushed into the economy the less frequent that money gets spent.

**So where is all this money going if it is not going into goods and services?** Economist largely believe that increases in the money supply probably inflate assets, including real estate, stocks, bonds and all other capital and financial assets. PE ratios have been on the rise for 30 years now. The average TTM PE ratio from 1928-1990 was 13.8 times. Since then it is 21x. The 10-year treasury yield from 1928-1990 averaged 5.17%. Since then 4.19%, and 3% in the last 20 years. The are further examples, but I think you can see that the decoupling of the money supply and inflation has probably benefited asset prices.

**TLDR**: Increasing the money supply does NOT lead to inflation in products and services like it once did. It now results in a lower velocity of money, more savings and higher asset prices.",1,Why investors should not be worried about the expansion of the money supply causing inflation in four easy charts.

There are massive changes coming, and management is very transparent with their plans. It's hard not to be optimistic when everything is laid out in front of you, while management outwardly expresses that they are undervalued.. and I tend to agree. There is little investor exposure, due to it being listed as a mining stock. Tech/healthcare followers would be far more interested. Uplistings to NASDAQ/TSX are expected later this year/2022. It has been stated by management, that institutions in the U.S. simply cannot invest in ZEN due to it being on the pink sheets, Institutional ownership, again is at 0.03%. There is significant interest by these institutions, and I anticipate Uplistings to be a catalyst of their own due to the liquidity increase.

What is it worth when they offer a extremely effective solution to air quality for personal protection and passive filtration?

When they offer a potential medicine that kills bacteria, viruses, and fungus?

When they offer rapid-aptamer fluid derived tests for virtually every pathogen?

$1 billion?

$5 billion?

$10 billion?

It definitely isn't worth $500 million, with one of these opportunities alone.

On possible upcoming 1-2 month releases:

* foreign agreements for approved product or other contracts,
* TSX uplisting, with voluntary de-listing from TSXV
* TSXV authorizing ZEN for change of business from mining to science, healthcare or industrial company, typically a change of business takes around 2 months
* corrosion resistant coating
* updates on antimicrobial,viral,fungal treatment, human trials TBA
* FDA process for U.S. approvals over 2-5 months, probably faster with process in Canada completed
* regulatory decision of Rapid aptamer saliva test for Covid and her variants, 6 months for full platform of most pathogens

With all the talks of a growing number of unicorns (from 165 new in 2020 to 403 new in 2021 according to [Crunchbase](https://news.crunchbase.com/news/crunchbase-unicorn-board-1000-companies/?utm_source=cb_weekend&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=20211002)) and private companies like SpaceX rapidly increasing in value, I want to know if I can invest/ trade options of private companies and get in early on the action?   


The first thing I found while this up was [Forge Global](https://forgeglobal.com/forge-markets/), a company that basically sells employ option shares of private companies, but they had tight requirements such as over $1 net worth and rigid terms for holding (12 months post-IPO). [Cap light](https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/10/is-buying-and-selling-short-positions-in-private-companies-next-this-fintech-startup-is-banking-on-it/), another start-up that trades equity derivatives for pre-IPO securities, solved the issue with holding period, but had the same issues with net worth.   


In the crypto verse, I found tokens of stocks by Mirror, FTX and Bittrex, so no issues with holding or minimum net worth, but they're simply mirroring existing markets, so no pre IPO stuff. The closest thing I found to invest/ trade in private companies was [prepo](https://simulator.prepo.io/), but they're not live yet.

The problem is that fee revenue will slowly decline over time, as more competition comes in that offers less fees steal customers away. A new app called [Strike](https://strike.me/) offers Bitcion trading at 0 fees (technically not 0, but less than a penny per trade). Coinbase will eventually need to evolve it's business model to stay competitive with companies like Strike.
2. **Morally questionable VC investing will lead to regulation**: Coinbase is doing some really slimy things with the tokens they list, and it will ultimately be their downfall. For those who are unaware, Coinbase has a VC arm called *Coinbase Ventures*. Basically, Coinbase buys up these early presales of these worthless tokens, brings these obscure tokens to market by listing them on their exchange and then dumps these tokens on retail investors at crazy valuations. Regulators will see this morally repugnant behavior and crack down on it.
3. **Most of the tokens on Coinbase will be retrospectively classified as securities**: Gary Gensler has said that ""Every ICO is a Security"", which makes the majority of tokens listed on the platform securities, including the second largest coin, Etheruem. Classifying them as securities means that Coinbase must legally delist them.
4. **Bitcoin ETF will steal the majority of volume away:** Grayscale has announced that they are looking to convert *all of* their funds into crypto ETFs, not just Bitcion. Meaning, you will see every altcoin all have their own ETF.

He said that it's an asset class that, until now, only the ultra-wealthy could afford. He says that, overall, it's outperformed every other asset class like stocks, bonds, real estate, etc.

He said what they do is buy paintings by established artists, form a LLC for each painting, then sell shares of that LLC to common folks like me for as little as $16K (he was willing to go as low as $8K for me to dip my toe in the water). He said it's just like real estate with comparable sales to tell us the value of each painting. He named soecific billionaires who bought paintings from artists whose paintings he said they have available for me and others.

Is art considered an asset class? I don't mean any art but mean blue chip paintings by more established artists like Jean-Michel Basquiat, Banksy, and George Condo?

$MCUR:  MDMA for female sexual dysfunction. Low sex drive is not a pathology in  itself, but the condition can  become problematic when it triggers  significant levels of personal  distress, [which can involve](https://obgyn.coloradowomenshealth.com/health-info/conditions/hypoactive-sexual-desire-disorder) sadness, a sense of grief, and feelings of incompetence, loss and frustration.

According  to MindCure, the hypoactive sexual desire disorder affects  “10% of  adult women and 14% of premenopausal adult women, all reporting  that  their low desire results in a state of distress.”

**In the U.S. the condition is believed to affect an estimated 9.5 million premenopausal women.**

Ramsden  says there are currently two available drugs in the market  targeting  this indication, both of which are aimed at women’s physiology  instead  of addressing the psychological causes behind the condition.  Their  success rate **goes only about 10% above placebo**.

$OTLC:   AL-101 drug for Female Sexual Dysfunction (FSD). FSD is a prevalent  problem, afflicting approximately 40% of women and there are few  available treatment options. FSD is more typical as women age, and is a  progressive and widespread condition. (Allahdadi, KJ et al. (2009)  Cardiovascular &amp; hematologicalagents in medicinalchemistry, 7(4),  260-269). There is no available drug for the treatment of FSD. HSDD is  characterized by a low sexual desire, that causes marked distress or  interpersonal difficulty, and is not due to a co-existing medical or  psychiatric condition, problems within the relationship or the effects  of a medication or other drug substance. HSDD affects approximately 5.8  million U.S. premenopausal women (1 in 10 premenopausal women). Almost  98%, approximately 5.7 million of affected premenopausal women are not  on any therapy for HSDD, either due to lack of education or lack of  therapies available. One in 10 premenopausal women have low desire with  associated distress. In June 2019, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration  approved Vyleesi (bremelanotide) to treat acquired, generalized HSDD in  premenopausal women. Currently, this is the only available drug  treatment. Vyleesi has essentially replaced the only other drug for HSDD  - however, it has a long list of drug-drug interactions, including  commonly used antidepressants, such as fluoxetine and sertraline. In  addition, it has a black box warning regarding its use with alcohol, a  combination that has been associated with hypotension and  syncopalepisodes. Therefore, there is an urgent need for an effective  therapy against FSD and HSDD.",1,$OTLC and $MCUR drugs for female sexual dysfunction

Samich_Boi,"**Introduction**

Today I want to bring up one of the biggest potential plays of the 21st century. When people talk about big plays, they often include trend that have already risen to popularity. For example, the electric vehicle market. Many investors continue to speculate in potentially extremely high future revenue  electric vehicles. Why? Well, everyone and their mother understand that electric vehicles are an inevitability; that is, in the future, we will all have them! The classic example of identifying a trend before it's dominance would have been to buy EV stock before their prevalence back in as early as 2010. I'm sure you have heard comparisons before, but if you had put just $500 into Tesla as soon as it was listed back in 2010, you would have about 22 grand today. But what if you had bought it lower? As low as $5? You would have 77 grand! So why this example? Of course this is such wishful thinking right? Well, I'd like to believe that those investors who bought at $5 knew their future. They identified the EV market as a trend and ran with it, not caring whether they bought at 5 or 50. They knew the power of the EV market.

&amp;#x200B;

**Marijuana and Cannabis: A Future of Opportunity** 

I want to start by saying that the marijuana market has been one that has been talked about for a long time now. Global investors have been speculating in marijuana for a long time as many understand it's future global implications. However, right now, current marijuana stock market caps do not represent it's potential. Even investors in NIO and Tesla understand that these companies are just starting to get a global foot in the door; yet, they have been speculating the prices of these commodities for years before their importance in the global market. Why? One simple answer: legalization.

&amp;#x200B;

Recent news proves that many countries are leaning towards legalization. Efforts in several South American countries have arisen for legalization, with big legislative movements in Columbia and Panama recently. The American market is becoming increasingly lenient on cannabis with a future headed in marijuana as well, and federal legalization is currently in legislative talks with most states edging towards decriminalization. 

&amp;#x200B;

As older generations continue to pass, social stigma towards marijuana is going down. It is a matter of time before the marijuana market booms.

&amp;#x200B;

We already saw the potential of the marijuana market before. If we look at one of the biggest competitors in the American market, Tilray, we can see how price action has been so dependent on news. In May to June of this year, the entire marijuana market boomed with news about future legalization, but no major efforts were made. So what could happen if legalization WAS approved?

&amp;#x200B;

**The Global Contenders: Whose on Top?**

When taking into consideration the global marijuana market, no one is a clear leader right now. While news for many companies have come out about big deals, none of these deals have been dominant enough to actually promote enough growth that it's worth talking about. Or wait. Maybe there has been?

&amp;#x200B;

ENTER FLORA GROWTH CORPORATION. TICKER: FLGC

&amp;#x200B;

The news for this company has been good after good after good with falling prices, just what I like to see! What exactly does this mean? Big money is slowly accumulating shares. This community does not allow the posting of pictures; however, looking at the price action of FLGC, we can see that major accumulation efforts are being made at the $5 mark, just a few cents below where it is trading right now. Even the slightest drop below $5 and the price can shoot as high as 6 dollars intraday just to go right back down to 5. Shifty? Absolutely! Smart and bullish? YES! 

&amp;#x200B;

Big money wants to accumulate as much of this stock as they can, they see the future in it. Just in the past month, FLGC has signed several big moves, such as jumping into the Panama cannabis market, promoting a massive research plan with marijuana and cannabis, launching a European market campaign, and entering the American market via hemp textiles.

&amp;#x200B;

Looking at production costs per gram makes FLGC look like a future monster. Flora produces marijuana at $0.06 a GRAM. For comparison, Tilray produces at $2.36 a gram and Sundial produces at $1.86 a gram.

&amp;#x200B;

Fundamentals become a tricky game to argue for Flora. While their growth is incredible, they are still losing money due to large loans. Is this a problem? I don't think so. I think by the end of this year, Flora will be boasting up to 10 times their revenue.

&amp;#x200B;

I highly recommend you inspect the Flora Growth price action, news, and fundamentals.

So here you are. Looking at tesla back in 2011, $5 a share. You have seen it get tanked from it's IPO price and you have seen it drop even lower. Why would you invest in it.

I don't just want to dump my whole lump sum into the market, partly with expectations of the market bwginning to correct over the next couple of years. I'd like to DCA the total sum in over time.

How do I determine the optimal timeline i.e. duration to give myself to invest the whole sum in increments?

How do I determine the portions to DCA the sum in? *I imagine that is just the # of periods you want to use in the interval and the transaction costs.

As we see more companies look to winding down property leases to increase their bottom line, there's 9.2 million jobs and $1.14 trillion in GDP potentially impacted by this shift (Source: [L.A. Times](https://www.latimes.com/b2b/cre/story/2021-06-15/commercial-development-and-operations-a-key-catalyst-for-u-s-economic-growth)).

So, the big question is what that shift looks like. There's the possibility of repurposing commercial space as retail and residential but that would take many years of rezoning, permits, retrofits, etc., and so some inefficiencies would arise, and the near term effect would still be a net decline in real estate value.

There will obviously also be some spaces retained for core staff, executive offices, meeting spaces, etc., but as the WeWork fiasco showed, the rank and file seem to be much more amenable to working from home than so-called dedicated coworking spaces.  How might this provide relief to related sectors, such as housing shortages with residential population booms? What does it do for income inequality?

Connorvo,"I scraped every new performance grant CEOs received in 2017 to see if copying those trades would beat the market. The initial results are very promising (12-25% ɑlpha on average depending on the timeframe), but more research needs to be done!

# How it works:

I wrote a python script that scraped every single Form 4 filed in 2017. It was only looking for filings that matched the below criteria:

1. The grant was a Performance Grant. Performance Grants are used to reward executives with stock only if they reach certain performance targets (the listing is when the targets are set, not when the targets are achieved)
2. The Performance Grant targets were for the stock to reach specified price targets. This means that the executive would receive stock ***only*** if the stock hit certain price targets during the given timeframe
3. The executive receiving the grant was a CEO or President.
4. The grant was not regularly scheduled (i.e. it wasn’t a grant they would receive every year). FIltering these out makes it more likely that the grant was given because the CEO and Board of Directors have confidence that the stock can reach the price targets.

# Overall Results

These kinds of grants don’t happen very often, there were only 9 of them in 2017, but they did indeed beat the market.

Of the 9 stocks that were found, all of them peaked at a price more than 35% above the performance grant and 6 of them peaked up more than 100% in the 3 years following the grant.

The below table is the average returns by months since the performance grant for the SPY and the stocks I found.

&amp;#x200B;

|Num months =&gt;|1|3|6|12|18|24|30|36|

|**SPY Returns**|1.83%|4.62%|7.41%|13.50%|14.40%|17.80%|22.87%|30.50%|

Taking a slightly closer look at “Max Returns” in the table below, we can see it took anywhere from 141 days to 1088 days for the stocks to reach their max return since the grant. The average was \~700 days, meaning it takes about 2 years for most of the stocks to hit their peak.

You will also see that 6 of the 9 stocks reached their performance grant targets. 2 of the 3 stocks that didn’t reach their targets had insanely high targets of 160% and 260% stock returns and both of the stocks had well over 100% returns. The other target that wasn’t reached had a 58% target but was the worst-performing stock

This grant only had one vesting date, February 6, 2020, but the grant would vest if it hit the price targets at any point between the grant date and February 6, 2020. The stock had vesting targets at $11, $14, and $18. The stock fell about 14% over the next 2.5 months before then popping up to $10.20 (37% return) about 5 months after the grant date. The stock then had a looooong fall for the next \~1.5 years until February 6, 2020. The stock recovered and reached all the way up to $15 after COVID, but the performance grant had already expired so they never received any of the awards.

The grant could begin vesting immediately and they had 2.5 years to reach the goal. The stock price immediately started going up after the performance grant and reached a local maximum of $10.55 (85% return) 4 months after the initial grant before spending the next year and a half going down to below $7. This grant was an all-or-nothing grant where the price had to reach $16 within 2.5 years to vest. It never reached that goal but maxed out at $12.53 (120% return) about 2 years after the initial grant.

“Each performance restricted stocked unit represents a contingent right to receive one share of Mitek common stock. No performance restricted stock unit vests (and thus no shares of common stock are issued) unless the fair market value of Mitek's common stock at the end of a set performance period or upon a change of control during such performance period is equal to or exceeds $16.00 per share. To incentivize relative performance of Mitek's stock price, reduced vesting could occur in the event Mitek's common stock price appreciation during the performance period underperforms against the Russell 2000 Index.”

Shares that do not become Performance Vested shall never become exercisable and shall be forfeited without consideration.

Similarly, if before September 30, 2022 Mr. Lebda's service is terminated for cause or he resigns without good reason, then any then unvested portion of the Performance Option shall be forfeited without consideration. After termination of Mr. Lebda's service, any then vested portion of the Performance Option shall generally remain exercisable until the earlier of (i) the expiration of the 12-month period following such termination of service,(ii) the date of a change of control of the Company if the Performance Option is not being assumed, replaced, substituted for or otherwise continued after the change of control, or (iii) July 26, 2027.

If there is a change of control of the Company, or if Mr. Lebda's service is terminated either due to his death or disability, or by us without cause, or by Mr. Lebda for good reason, then the performance based nonqualified stock option can become partially or fully vested on an accelerated basis based on the measurement of the stock price based performance goals under the applicable circumstances and the deemed satisfaction of time based vesting conditions.”

These grants could start paying out immediately upon hitting the $15 target and they had until the end of 2020 to hit that goal. Unlike most grants, they only gave an all-or-nothing $15 price target instead of tiered price targets that start out easier to hit. They never quite got to the $15 price target but did cross $13 (almost a 200% return) right around the 1-year mark.

It then tumbled again before reaching its overall maximum of almost $130 3 years later. Because the performance grant required at least one year to pass before reaching the target stock price would count towards the grant, the execs actually didn't start receiving the grant awards until the end of 2020 when the stock started going on a tear

It crossed $10 about 7 months after the grant and peaked at $12 about 9 months after the grant before crashing for almost 2 years and then spiking up above $20 about 3 years later. This grant was only able to start paying out between the 1st and 3rd anniversary of the grant, so even though the execs hit the target price 9 months later, they didn't start getting paid out until close to the 3-year mark when they finally got above the target price again

# FAQs / Concerncs

***What is a Form 4?***

A Form 4 is filed any time an executive at a public company buys, sells, or is granted stock. They are required to file with the SEC within 3 days of taking the action

***Why did you pick 2017?***

Most performance grants have a timeline that is 3 years or shorter (though some are up to 5 years). 2017 ensures enough time has passed for the grant to actually play out

***Where did you get the data?***

The SEC has a database (EDGAR) that lets you scrape all of the info from all of the SEC filings

***Why did you pick the timeframes you chose (1 month, 3 months, 6 months, 12 months, 18 months, 24 months, 30 months, 36 months)?***

No particular rhyme or reason. I felt like these gave a pretty good overview of the short, medium, and long-term returns for each grant.

***9 stocks aren’t very many***

True. The sample size is very small. I am in the process of doing the analysis for more years to increase this number, but the number will never get very large as these types of grants don't happen super often.

**This isn't adjusted for risk in any way**

This is also true. These stocks vary from small to large market cap and have different levels of volatility which can affect the returns on a risk-adjusted basis. It may be worth diving into risk adjustments at some point, but right now I want to focus on gathering more data and seeing if there are any potentially viable investment strategies around the data.

# Takeaways

I definitely think this is promising, but the hard part is putting it into action. Obviously, if we could see the future and sell at the max price for all of the stocks, we’d all make millions, but the stocks don’t all just go up and to the right.

Some of them fall before popping, some pop and then fall, some pop then fall then pop even more.

There is potentially a viable strategy involving holding the stocks until they reach some return threshold (maybe like 25%) and then letting it run with a stop-loss, but I think I need more data to build better strategies. I will work on gathering more data.",1,I scraped every CEO Performance Grant in 2017. Does copying them beat the market? The early results are positive!

guanciallee,"There are a lot of disclaimers for this post that are extremely important. As a result, I have included them at the end indicated like so ^**1**. Additionally, I walk through the math so that everyone can understand the process and for people wanting to critique/question. There is a TL;DR at the end but without context, it's pretty unbelievable. 

### Sourcing Data
Every list of American Mutual funds has slight errors (even this [one](https://investexcel.net/complete-list-of-mutual-funds-across-all-international-exchanges/)). So I created a list with [Market Watch](https://www.marketwatch.com/tools/mutual-fund/list?firstLetter=A) of around 25,000 mutual fund tickers. Most mutual funds have multiple different tickers because of different shares/classes. Each class contains the same investments it's just variations on your fee structure ^**1**. So I counted only one example from each mutual fund ^**2**. This is controversial but I believe it will give the most accurate results. [This](https://imgur.com/a/BI4vCvB) example I would have kept two because there are only two mutual funds here. You shouldn't include every share/class because it will have an overrepresentation of certain mutual funds.

I used the stock history function in Excel to find the price of each ticker on the 1st of every year since 1990^**3**. If it didn't have a price I got rid of it for that particular year. For context at the beginning of 2021, I have around 6700 unique mutual funds in my list^**4**. 

###The Math
I did the following calculations for every American Mutual Fund since 1990 ^(**5** Big disclaimer). First I calculated the percent change from each first day of the year to the next first day of the year (2020 Jan 2/2019 Jan 2)-1. Many people calculate change inside of a year but I did the math for gains of a year gap instead. As long as I use the same timeframe every time the math is sound. The percent amounts might be slightly different than what is commonly publicized. Secondly, I calculated the percent change from the beginning of every year from 1990 until now ^**6** (1990-Now, 1991-Now, 1992-Now Etc.). 

I chose these two calculations because one is a very common attribute (year difference) and since most people buy and hold mutual funds for many years I wanted to see what the result would be holding for many years until now. I then calculated averages for these two distinct calculations for each year. As well as trimming 2.5% Top+Bottom and 10% Top+Bottom of mutual funds to exclude outliers and calculating a new percentage with that (keeping all 3 results for each calculation/year). 

###Index Funds
I chose S&amp;P500 (.INX) Dow Jones Industrial Average (.DJI) and Nasdaq Composite (.IXIC) and found their historical prices via Google Sheets. The same math calculations were done for the same timeframe gaps (i.e single year gaps and each year until now gaps). 

###Analysis
I started by comparing the 'each year till now' percentages for mutual funds to the three indexes. I can also calculate what percentage of mutual funds each index is higher than in each specific calculation. Here are the results from [1990-Now](https://imgur.com/a/Ga3pSNq). It becomes quite apparent that the order of best returns goes Nasdaq, S&amp;P then Dow Jones. Each Index normally beats out  90%+ of Mutual funds for each timeframe (sometimes 98%+). Even if you bought at the peak of the dot-com bubble (2000) or before the 2008 crash, each index would still beat the overwhelming majority of Mutual funds from that same time frame. If you knew to buy any index in the '90s it's a slaughter. 


Looking at only this data doesn't take into account a random great year for an index fund. As well there is a common notion that Mutual funds might not gain much but they shield you from losses. Let's address that by diving into the other calculation I did with the percent change from a year to the next year. 


Here is [1990-Now](https://imgur.com/a/wSEychd). Red cells indicate when an index is lower than the average mutual fund from that year. The results are when the indexes are down the average mutual fund is also very much down (Out of the 8 times S&amp;P closed negative since 1990 4 times it still outperformed the average mutual fund). There has never been a year where any index was negative yet the average mutual fund was positive. The indexes are usually beating 55-90% of mutual funds every year (With them beating 90%+ many times). Dow has beaten the average yearly mutual fund return 66% of the time in the past 30 years, S&amp;P &amp; Nasdaq being 80%. The dot-com bubble is the exception to the stellar performance where a difference between index funds and mutual funds is notable.

###Conclusion

Picking a mutual fund that somehow outperforms any index is a massive uphill battle because the indexes usually beat 55-90% of mutual funds every year (with them beating 90%+ many times). Normally you hold mutual funds for many years, so even if you succeed in choosing a winner one particular year you will still eventually lag behind the index funds. The longer timeframe the more likely (Index funds beating 92%+ of mutual funds over time is the norm)

You can make a lot of observations from this data and that's what I am going for. Make your own conclusions but keep in mind most statistics relating to the mutual fund world are not primary sources. Most of the time people are trying to convince you to buy Mutual Fund XYZ. This post is primary research where you could easily replicate my findings. 

The biggest flaw to this data is the fact that we've been in a record bull market which means aggressive investments look better in hindsight. That's why looking at both calculations I did is important, so you can see a clearer picture. You could easily do much more math to find patterns before the current record bull market. For example, calculate percent changes from various timeframes such as 1990-2018, 1991-2018 or 1990-1995, 1991-1996 or 1990-1992, 1990-1993, etc. I can calculate and post some of them if people request them. This is not financial advice.


### TLDR
The overwhelming majority of mutual funds can't compete with either Dow, Nasdaq, or S&amp;P any way you slice the data. They don't come close to competing in terms of gains and still perform badly in years when the index funds perform badly (they sometimes perform even worse during these years, the dot-com bubble is the exception). You get roughly the same amount of losses but with only a slight portion of the gains. Even if you choose a mutual fund winner one year your multi-year investment will eventually lag behind the index funds by quite a lot.

^(**3** Occasionally Excel would give a unique error on the first trading day of the year to some mutual fund tickers. So I would alter the queried data to the next historical trading day.)

^(**4** There could still be mutual funds that Market Watch doesn't document and/or Microsoft cant query. This is a dilemma that I decided to ignore. There is just no real way to get around this.)

^(**5** Flaw in my data here is that I can't find old historical lists of mutual funds while also finding the historical prices of said mutual funds. I can only find a current list of mutual funds and historical prices of whatever is currently listed. This is an example of survivorship bias because I won't have the data for any mutual funds that were available but delisted before 2021. As I move further back in time my original list of 6700 mutual funds shrinks every year. If I had to guess this influences my results in my post to be slightly higher returns than the truth. This is because any mutual funds that performed horribly and delisted before 2021 wouldn't be included in my math above.)

Eloqpolma,"I’ve been investing on some physical for some time now, since I believe that this will be the period of commodities and assets. Got myself invested in some physical gold and silver, but right now that I have some little extra that I have right now, and I’m planning on putting a part of it into mining stocks. I’m still adding some physical, but I’ve been looking into some stocks recently that I want to invest in.

I’m planning to invest in Newmont ([NEM](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/NEM/)) because they’re among the biggest so it’s pretty safer and sure to invest in them. When big money returns to this sector, they always begin with the miners in the big indexes. Also thinking of placing some on Freeport-McMoran ([FCX](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/FCX/)) which is a great value stock, with it being one of the bigger players in mining. Their stocks have risen 1.16% in premarket trading.

Also looking into juniors like Lundin Gold ([LUG.TO](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/lug.to/)). They own the [Fruta Del Norte](https://www.lundingold.com/en/fruta-del-norte/project-overview/) gold mine, and while there was a slight slowdown in production in 2020, they managed to have a production of 108,799 ounces of gold produced in the second quarter of this year.

It is expected that their next results could be a bigger catalyst than their previous discovery. They are showing a lot of potential as the drillings continue.

Nootherids,"I am trying to better understand what are the best approaches to formulate several investment accounts that focus separately on short, medium, long, and retirement terms. The retirement I'm ok with as my 401k and Roth would operate with standard mutual fund principles. I am also fully aware of the concept of Dollar Cost Averaging.

What I'm trying to decipher in my head is understanding the link between the power of Compound Interest in combination to the above investment terms. I already understand the relation of compounding in the scope of dividends. You get the dividends and they get automatically reinvested, perfect. But my question here is related to stocks, mutual funds, and ETFs. I will lay out how I understand them (ignoring the concepts of dividends altogether, so let's assume none of them disburse any dividends).

Stocks: You buy at one price. The stock goes up in price accounting for your unrealized gains. You must sell your stock (at profit) to now have realized gains. Then you have to reinvest your entire investment amount, which is initial investment + realized profit, to achieve the concept of Compounding. I just don't think this seems very reasonable for a non-professional investor, am I correct in that opinion?

Mutual Funds: You buy at the current price of the fund. The fund is actively managed and buys and sells stocks as necessary. Each time it sells a stock at profit it creates a realized gain. That gain is disbursed automatically and acts as your Compounding interest. My question is does this happen regularly or sporadically? Meaning are you actually realizing a true Compounding effect here or not really?

ETFs: They are mutual funds that act like stocks. I read some places that they will auto-reinvest any dividends they disburse but I don't know how. And since they are not actively traded then holding any ETF for the long term will not create any Compounding effect, unless you play them as stocks like stated above. Am I wrong here too?

Conclusion...Gains in the market whether stocks, funds, or ETF, are always referred to as Annualized Returns. What I'm trying to grasp my head around are whether general Gains in the market are indicative of ""Simple Interest"" or ""Compound Interest""? And being that Compound Interest is so powerful from a long term perspective, should I just stop thinking about Compounding altogether (assuming I'm not looking specifically for dividend yielding investments ATM) while I'm making these decisions? I keep running calculators seeing how an investment would grow depending on variables and of course it asks what the annual interest rate is; but some ask for compounding rate and some don't. So I don't really know which I should be looking at.

Note...I am looking to invest an initial amount of roughly $5-$20k spread over 3-4 accounts for different time frames, and injecting about $2k per month (total, not each). Just so you understand that I'm not talking amounts in the hundreds of thousands here. But being that my funds are relatively limited and I don't want to make the wrong decisions, I realized that I'm getting a bit stuck in Analysis Paralysis. So I come to you fine people. TIA

Bonus Question: Are ETF prices set by the changes in supply/demand from traders like stocks are, or are they set by the index that they track? Meaning, can the index signify that the ETF should be at $50, but investor sentiment crash the ETF down to $0, like they could with a stock? Or make it skyrocket like GME? Meaning are things like technical or price action analysis what investors use to determine the price or is the price actually linked to the underlying securities and investors just ride the wave up and down?",1,Stock/Funds/ETF Gains: Unrealized vs Realized vs Compound [Question]

The country societal problems are rearing it's head - The ruling party restricting rights, and then the one child policy is beginning show negative economic ramifications, in that, they have too much of an aging population.  


The ruling party are trying to fix all of their issues right now, wit heavy debt restructuring revamping social programs. But right now it looks like China is being rocked with a lot of issues.  


China is eyeing expansion of power - war with Taiwan and seizure of Hong Kong. What will be the economic ramifications of those events to China, and to the world? Yet to be seen.

Since the data is at least partially unstructured the software is a sort of personal big data tool, with not so much big data, but the capability to process unstructured data to get an idea of a possible sentiment. The capability to get a sentiment from news in the case of extraordinary events would be great too. For example the drought in the US caused some lesser harvests.

redmars1234,"Tesla has bucked the wider trend of declining sales brought on by the global chip shortage in the third quarter this year, as it sold 241,300 cars — a total of 102,000 more vehicles than the same quarter last year.

Dragoon1311,"  Maybe a good play with rising Ukraine Gas prices:

KUB (CAD) / TPNEF (USD) looks even better with Ukraine Gas prices rising to 18,000 MCM (valuta is UAH). 18,000 MCM in September (Cubic Meters, Before VAT/Taxes) according to the table on the website and last quarter was an average of $6.50 MCF (Cubic Feet, After VAT/Taxes) in the MD&amp;A Q2. This was with an average 9,400 MCM (April - June) on the website. Meaning Gas prices will be up with 66% in Q3 (upcoming numbers) compared to Q2. KUB uses no hedges.

In Q2 2021 KUB made 500K USD profit. RK field with electricity was only online for half the quarter, 100K profit, but using the numbers it can be 200K USD so 250K CAD in profit. This means that the Gas business was 500K CAD profit with all 'fixed costs' included and September is more than double the Gas prices (after VAT/Taxes).

I look forward to next Quarter (Q3) with the average at 15,600 MCM (July - September) compared to 9,400 in Q2. A 66% increase.

MrNoodleIncident,"My company offers an employee stock purchase plan which includes a discount on each purchase.   You determine how much you want for the year, the company pulls some money from each paycheck, and then purchases the stock quarterly. So our plan has been to put a good amount in to the program, sell throughout the year whenever the price is high (only lots we have held for 12+ months), then put the cash back in the program to buy more.  The logic is that we get the discount over and over, while also minimizing our concentration in this one stock.

Market_Madness,"#**Introduction**
Everyone talks about what to invest in, but they often skip a step when talking to beginners. What to invest in starts with knowing what is available. Here are the fundamental investment types I will be covering today:


* Stocks – fractional ownership of a company sold in the form of shares
* Bonds – a loan to a company or government that will pay interest in the future
* Commodities – a raw material or agricultural product that can be bought or sold
* Mutual Funds and ETFs  – containers holding many stocks, bonds, or commodities


Each of these have their own unique set of attributes and uses. They’re differentiated based on risk, specialization, and ease of use. I might go into these details in the future, but for now I want to start at the very beginning. 

#**Stocks**
Let’s say you own a business. You currently only have one location but would like to open another. You know your business is worth about $1 million dollars and that it costs $100,000 to open a new store. You decide to create 10,000 shares and attempt to sell them for $100 each. Each share represents a 0.01% ownership stake in the company. Let’s say you sell 2,000 of the shares. Now you own 8,000 shares and the person or people you sold the shares to own 2,000. This means you own 80% of the company and the others own 20%. They paid you $200,000 for those shares which you can now use to open two new stores. 

So why did the people in the example buy $200,000 worth of your business’s stock? People buy stocks for two primary reasons. The first is that they expect the business to do well. A business that does well will grow and increase the value of its shares. This is called capital appreciation. If you go ahead and builds two more stores that generate the same income as the first, the value of the business will have roughly tripled. The $200,000 that was invested could now easily be worth $600,000. On the other hand, what if you tried to open two new stores and they both failed? Everyone would see that you’re bad at running this business and those shares might only be worth $100,000 now. The second reason is to collect dividend payments from the business. A dividend is when a company takes a portion of its earnings and pays them out to its shareholders. These are more common among older well established businesses that have consistent income.

Stocks are most commonly traded on stock exchanges. The United States is home to the two largest exchanges in the world, the New York Stock Exchange, and the Nasdaq Stock Market. To buy or sell stocks yourself on the exchanges you need to go through a brokerage. This might sound like a daunting process but can usually be set up in less than 15 minutes. Once you have an account set up and money deposited buying and selling shares is nearly instantaneous. 

#**Bonds**
When you need to make a large purchase like a new car you don’t typically pay it all up front. You might not have enough money at the moment or want a way to spread the purchase out over time. To do this you get a loan. Let’s say you want to buy a $20,000 car. You spend $4,000 on the down payment and agree to pay the rest over the next three years. You get to take the car home today because the loan pays the dealership the remaining amount owed. In return for lending you this money the bank is going to charge interest as you pay the loan back. Let’s assume the interest rate is 3% per year. At this rate you’ll end up paying the bank back about $16,751. The additional $751 is their payment for taking on the risk of loaning you that money.

Bonds and loans have a lot in common. They’re both used to finance expensive purchases, have interest rates, and cover a set period of time. There are some differences though. The car loan was paid off in monthly payments over the course of three years. Each monthly payment paid some of the interest as well as some of the initial $16,000 principal. Let’s say you’re the bank. Instead of writing a car loan you use the money to buy a bond worth $16,000 at the same 3% interest rate over the same three year period. As the holder of the bond you would be entitled to interest rate payments, twice per year, for three years. Each semiannual payment would be 1.5% of $16,000 or $240. After three years the bond would mature, you would receive your last interest payment, and you would receive your entire $16,000 back.

Let’s take a look at how stocks and bonds compare. Both of them can be used to raise money, but they do so in significantly different ways. When you buy stock you are buying a fractional ownership in the business. You do not get your initial investment back unless the company pays dividends, or you sell your shares and give up ownership. Bonds can also be used to raise money, but they do not offer any ownership. When a company sells bonds it knows that it will have to pay them back in the future which can be costly. When it sells stock its current shareholders lose some of their ownership and therefore value. Let’s say there are 100 shares of company XYZ and they decided to issue 20 more. Previously every share was worth 1% of the company, now every share is only worth 0.83% of the company. This is only the tip of the iceberg when it comes to understanding what stocks and bonds are and how they compare to each other. 

#**Commodities**
Stocks and bonds are each considered to be an asset class. An asset class is a group of investments that have similar characteristics and have to follow the same regulations. Stock in Apple is not the exact same as stock in Visa, but they serve the same purpose, can be traded the same way, and follow the same rules. The same can be said about bonds. A bond that takes seven years to mature is not the exact same as one that takes ten years, but they are both going to be structured the same. The third asset class we will be covering are commodities.

A commodity is a raw material or primary agricultural product. These products are essentially the same regardless of where they come from. Copper, gold, oil, iron, and lumber are all examples of raw material commodities. Corn, soybeans, meat, and milk are all agricultural commodities. There may be minor fluctuations in quality, but in order to be traded on exchanges they need to meet a minimum requirement. These materials form the foundation of almost everything our economy produces. 

Unlike with stocks or bonds, commodities are not used as a way to raise money. They’re traded as a way to protect the producer from risk. Let’s say you can grow 10,000 bushels of wheat in a good year. You would like to get at least $8 per bushel once it’s harvested. What happens if there is a perfect year for crops and everyone else has produced more than expected. This increase in supply pushes the price lower because buyers have more to choose from. The price per bushel is now only $5. In this situation you would only earn 63% as much as you were forecasting which can be hard to handle as a business. In order to protect yourself from this situation you might want to create a contract with a wheat buyer on an exchange. This contract could include you agreeing to sell your wheat for $7 per bushel at the end of the summer. This is less than the $8 you are hoping for, but it will be guaranteed. Assuming the person buying the contract was also expecting wheat to be worth $8 per bushel, they will see this as a good deal. When prices for materials are known in advance it’s easier to budget and plan which is a benefit for both parties. 

Odds are you aren’t looking to buy or sell massive quantities of wheat, or any other raw materials. If you’re looking at investing in commodities it’s probably going to be in oil, gold, or common metals like copper. Thankfully you don’t need to be directly trading contracts with the producers to do this. There are shares that can be bought and sold like stocks on a stock exchange. Each share represents a fixed amount of the commodity, such as an ounce of gold or a barrel of oil. The primary reason people buy commodities is to protect themselves from inflation. This works because as the price of things increase, the price of the raw materials must also increase. 

#**Mutual Funds and Exchange Traded Funds**
Now that you have an idea of what the three most popular asset classes are, let’s take a look at a couple of the tools associated with them. Mutual funds and ETFs are both collections of stocks, bonds, or commodities that can be traded. Instead of hand selecting companies, bonds, or commodities these collections allow you to purchase a fraction of many of them all at once. 

The S&amp;P 500 is an index that tracks 500 of the largest companies in the United States. It’s often used as a general gauge for the US economy. If the economy is doing well and growing, this index will also be growing. Instead of having to purchase shares in all 500 businesses by hand there are numerous ETFs that will do that for you. The most popular one has a ticker name of SPY. When you buy a share of SPY, 5.9% of your money is being put in Apple stock, 2.29% is put into Facebook stock, and so on. The larger the company the larger the fraction of your money they get. This is called a market cap weighed fund. 

SPY is an ETF which means you can buy or sell it at any time with ease. FXAIX also covers the companies of the S&amp;P 500, but it is a mutual fund. What is the difference between the two? Well there’s not much. The most noticeable one is that mutual funds cannot be traded throughout the day. They can only be purchased at the end of the day. Although not a rule, mutual funds are much more likely to be actively managed than an ETF. Active management means there is a professional portfolio manager in charge of selecting when to buy or sell the things the mutual fund holds. ETFs are much more likely to be passively managed. This means they track a set list of stocks automatically.

#**Conclusion**
These four categories make up a vast majority of investments. Being able to understand how each of them work is crucial in making your own investment choices. Hopefully this post was able to bring up even more questions than it answered if you're new. Now that you know what the major fundamental asset classes are you might ask yourself why you would choose one over the other. This was touched on, but I never went into detail on the risk, return, history, or combination of them. All of these ideas warrant their own posts which may come in the future.

https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1874178/000119312521289903/d157488ds1.htm

Rivian Automotive, a company developing electric vehicles, including commercial delivery vans for Amazon, filed for an initial public offering on Friday. The company aims to trade on the Nasdaq under the ticker symbol “RIVN.”

Its paperwork shows a $994 million net loss on zero revenue in the first six months of 2021. In 2020 the company’s net loss came to $1.02 billion.

The company wrote in its filing, “We are a development stage company and have not generated material revenue to date. Vehicle production and deliveries began in September 2021.” Rivian beat Tesla, GM and Ford to the market with an electric pickup, the R1T, which has received glowing early reviews. The company plans to launch a seven-passenger SUV called the R1S in December, it said in the filing.

CEO RJ Scaringe, who has a Ph.D. from the Sloan Automotive Laboratory at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, founded Rivian in 2009. The company is based in Irvine, Calif., with 6,274 employees as of the end of June. It operates a vehicle assembly plant in Normal, Illinois.

Amazon and Ford each own more than 5% of the company. Peter Krawiec, Amazon’s senior vice president of worldwide corporate and business development, sits on Rivian’s board.

Rivian’s commercial vehicle business will be highly dependent on Amazon for the foreseeable future. The company said Amazon has some exclusive rights to purchase electric delivery vehicles from Rivian for at least four years, and the right of first refusal after that.

Like Tesla, Rivian remains a non-unionized automaker for now. The company’s filing acknowledged that this status could change and impact labor costs.

FlamingOrange,"I mean, it may sound odd at first but here's my thinking. Saving, especially especially interest rates as low as they are, won't do much at all ever. you could quite literally make more money in a shorter amount of time by going coin scavenging in parking lots. 

But while the most obvious example of this would be, say, spending 50 dollars to buy a share of a stock, and the stock price increases. you now spent money to make money. But isn't that the only option with *everything* and *anything* at this point? there is no point in saving money, so your only other option is to spend that money to invest it, whether it is in yourself, the stock market, or something physical that has value, such as a house or business you own yourself. 

It just seems like there is no point in saving money. With inflation, among virtually no positives to just saving money when it does nothing, it seems like the best way to preserve or build wealth is to just spend it, right? People might look at your bank account and think you're broke without realizing that you have actual assets working for you, either with real estate, stocks, etc. 

This is just my thinking. I invest every single penny i do not need to live. The other plus side about buying physical things or stocks is they have value past just being an investment. you can for example, live in a house or your business, or your stocks are working for you in terms of price appreciation, dividends, or you can get more money by spending money to further your skills, trade, or education, etc. 


it just seems like there's no reason not to spend money. a lot of people i know seem to be saving money under their mattress and have it just be doing nothing. it just makes no sense to have money doing nothing if you don't use it or have it work for you.",1,Is it true that you should always spend money to build wealth? is there any reason to save money you don't need?

Speedmaster88,"I'm currently reading Security Analysis (Second edition), it mention how interests, amortization and depreciation will greatly affect the company's earning, and how by undervaluing it's assets the company can ""increase"" it's earning (because of less depreciation). However I didn't see any mention on how a bond's maturity will affect the earning. For example:

&amp;#x200B;

Let's say a company issues a 10-Y 5% $1000 bond, so each year it has to pay $50 in interests, it's gross earning is $200.   


So $200 - 50 (interests) -30 (depreciation) -10 (amortization) -20 (taxes) = $90 net earning per year, meaning that if earning doesn't increases the company won't be able to pay back it's $1000 debt upon maturity, even though the interested payments are fully covered. Shouldn't the company be setting money aside for the bond's maturity, and shouldn't that be deducted from it's earning like depreciation and amortization?  


also, what's keeping the stockowners from giving themselves a $90 dividend and giving the middle finger to the bondholders? (the company would still be paying the interests, and would not default until the 10-Y maturity, so the stockowners could milk it for 10 years)",1,How does a Bond's maturity affects the earning statement of a company?

All other PUTs have since been re-filed on **6/30/2021**.

I believe these dates indicate historical Collateralized Loan Obligation (CLO) activity associated with GameStop and provide an indication of what to expect as we move towards **9/30/2021** and onward.

Background

In January, February 2021 $126.6 billion of loans were said to have been repriced ([S+P Global - March 12th, 2021](https://www.spglobal.com/marketintelligence/en/news-insights/latest-news-headlines/quick-take-us-clo-refinancing-and-reset-activity-surges-63108875)).

Archegos was liquidated between March 12th and March 26th, 2021 ([Credit Suisse - July 29th, 2021](https://www.credit-suisse.com/media/assets/corporate/docs/about-us/investor-relations/financial-disclosures/results/csg-special-committee-bod-report-archegos.pdf)). It’s been said that the firm turned **$10 billion into an estimated $100 billion** worth of assets ([Bloomberg - April 3rd, 2021](https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2021-04-03/the-number-of-the-week-is-100-billion)).

&gt;“Typically, for new-issue transactions, the CLO debt tranches are collectively 10 times the size of the notional amount of the equity interest.” - [https://www.stout.com/en/insights/article/primer-valuation-clo-equity-financial-reporting](https://www.stout.com/en/insights/article/primer-valuation-clo-equity-financial-reporting)

On March 26th, 2021 the Fed reported a daily Reverse Repurchase amount of $11.4 billion. By March 31st, the daily Reverse Repurchase amount skyrocketed up to $134 billion. An increase of $124.297 billion. ([St. Louis Federal Reserve - RRP Chart](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/)). This was notable because the Fed’s RRP activity had been effectively dormant until this uptick.

Hypothesis

As evidenced by the volume of CLO repricing in Jan/Feb, the end date of the Archegos liquidation, proportion of equity compared to total Archegos assets and uptick in RRPs on March 31st, 2021 my reading leads me to believe that Archegos was more of a CLO Manager than Family Office and that some of their positions (illiquid investments in junk-grade CLOs) were auctioned off and then repriced to SOFR at the end of March 2021.

Historically CLOs were priced off 3-month LIBOR but, out of concern the benchmark was being manipulated by financial institutions, the Federal Reserve is in the process of transitioning CLOs to their own rate called SOFR that is based on the daily RRP amounts ([Bloomberg - July 8th, 2021](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-07-08/growing-clo-market-has-a-libor-transition-problem-on-horizon)).

9/30/2021 is 3 days away and represents the 2nd-ever quarterly refinancing of CLOs after the formal recommendation of SOFR was made by the Alternative Reference Rates Committee ([AARC](https://www.newyorkfed.org/arrc)) on July 29th, 2021.

There is a process called “Warehousing” in the CLO world where “CLO Managers purchase initial collateral before the closing date” which typically lasts 3-6 months ([Pinebridge - September 19th, 2019](https://www.pinebridge.com/en/insights/clo-beyond-the-complexity)).

**9/30/2021 represents the 6-month mark since Simplex filed their 80,702 PUT contracts**.

GME close on 3/31/2021: $189.82

GME close on 6/30/2021: $214.14

GME close on 9/30/2021: ???

Conclusion

While many of my posts have historically shied away from dates I believe the evidence here is too clear and strong to avoid mention. Worth noting 9/30/2021 is just *a* date and, given the fact the average tenor of Archegos’ contracts was 24 months, there could be many other interesting ones as well.",1,Why I’m Expecting a Big Week for GME

&gt;Unfortunately, between **March and May 20, 2021**, you were a victim of a third-party campaign to gain unauthorized access to the accounts of Coinbase customers and move customer funds off the Coinbase platform. At least 6,000 Coinbase customers had funds removed from their accounts, including you.  
&gt;  
&gt;In order to access your Coinbase account, these third parties first needed prior knowledge of the email address, password, and phone number associated with your Coinbase account, as well as access to your personal email inbox. While we are not able to determine conclusively how these third parties gained access to this information, this type of campaign typically involves phishing attacks or other social engineering techniques to trick a victim into unknowingly disclosing login credentials to a bad actor. We have not found any evidence that these third parties obtained this information from Coinbase itself.  
&gt;  
&gt;Even with the information described above, additional authentication is required in order to access your Coinbase account. However, in this incident, for customers who use SMS texts for two-factor authentication, the third party took advantage of a flaw in Coinbase’s SMS Account Recovery process in order to receive an SMS two-factor authentication token and gain access to your account.  
&gt;  
&gt;Once in your account, the third party was able to transfer your funds to crypto wallets unassociated with Coinbase.

From a shareholder perspective, I think this is very egregious that this was happening around the time of the IPO, but they didn't disclose this until just now. This news was withheld and kept under wraps for months, and could be related to the heavy selling we've seen from company executives since the IPO back in April.",1,"Coinbase Hacked, Funds From Least 6,000 Customers Wiped Out"

Puzzleheaded_Bus_418,"Disclosure: I’m long ~550 shares of OPEN and plan on buying short dated calls the week before earnings that expire the following week. 

I wanted to provide an update on my post from earlier in Q3 where I tried estimating Opendoor’s Q3 revenue. 

Now that Q3 is over we have a full picture of the transactions that occurred and can (hopefully) predict the outcome of Q3 revenue. OPEN provided guidance of $1.9 - $2B for Q3. 

I used ibuyerstats.com to analyze all transactions. In Q3, I calculated an estimated 9,218 homes were removed from the website. At an average value of $345,000 per home, that would total $3.18B in revenue. However, using Q2 data from the website and press release I was able to determine that 12% of the homes removed from listing were removed for purposes other than a sale. Therefore, if you remove the 12% (assuming this stays close to consistent in Q3) I estimate revenues will land around $2.7B. Not often do you see 40% beats on revenue estimates, but this is very possible. 

Here’s to a $3.5B+ Q4 and a $15B+ FY2021.

One other thing to note: OPEN was predicting profitability in 2025 not long ago. They are likely to be come profitable in Q3 or Q4 THIS YEAR. Get in while you can.",1,OPENDOOR ($OPEN) Q3 Results

CoalFlavored,"Let me start out by saying that I am **NOT** a professional analyst, and that this is **NOT** investment advice. I am simply sharing the research I’ve done on this company. I own around 325 shares.

**1.** **What is Cybin?**

Cybin is a budding Toronto-based biotech company whose goal is to produce psychedelic-based therapeutic medicines for addressing various mental health issues. The psychedelic in question is Psilocybin, the active compound found in so-called “magic mushrooms”. They aim to do this through proprietary drug discovery, new drug delivery systems, and new formulation and approaches for different psychiatric disorders. For the most part, these psychiatric disorders include Major Depressive Disorder and several types of substance abuse including alcohol and nicotine. Millions around the world are afflicted by these issues, and of course that comes with a multi-billion dollar healthcare opportunity.

**2.** **Why Psilocybin?** 

Over the past few years, research has been conducted concerning psilocybin’s effect on mental health, with some promising results. Here are the recent studies that Cybin specifically cites -

[**Journal of Humanistic Psychology, 2017 – Alexander Belser et. al.**](https://assets-global.website-files.com/6022582598960827c7789b33/603d2d72126ce0c8a33f0f14_Patient%20experiences.pdf)

This study bills itself as the “first qualitative study of participant experiences in psilocybin-assisted psychotherapy”. It was a relatively small study with only 13 participants aged 22 to 69 with an average age of 50 years. All were affected by elevated anxiety associated with a cancer diagnosis. They were provided doses of psilocybin and therapy – and the transcripts from those therapy sessions were analyzed to find common themes.

Among all or most of the subjects reported easing of their symptoms and a desire to repeat the experience of taking psilocybin. Some participants showed strong positive reactions to the treatment, such as improved relationships and catharsis of powerful emotion.

The overall conclusion of the study is that psilocybin-assisted therapy may provide an effective treatment for psychological distress in cancer patients.

Some background on the main author –

Alexander Belser holds a PhD in Counseling Psychology from New York University and was a clinical research fellow at Yale 2018-2019. He has spent a couple of decades researching the possibility of psychedelic based clinical treatment with several peer-reviewed journal articles. 2015-2017 He also served on the Board of Advisors for Compass Pathways – a well-known mental health care company. **He is the Chief Clinical Officer of Cybin as of November 2020.**

[**Elsevier Journal of Psychiatry Research, 2020 – Simon Goldberg, et. al.**](https://assets-global.website-files.com/6022582598960827c7789b33/603935b9a45a717eeb9287d5_Meta-analysis%20-%20experimental%20effects%20of%20psilocybin%20on%20symptoms%20of%20anxiety%20and%20depression.pdf)

In this meta-analysis, 117 participants were studied across 4 groups; 3 with randomized-placebo controlled tests and 1 uncontrolled. All participants were clinically evaluated to be experiencing elevated levels of anxiety and/or depression. Biases attempted to be mitigated through study design included selection, performance, detection, attrition, and reporting bias.

Analysis showed an “evident” effect with statistically significant reductions in anxiety and/or depression systems based on clinical evaluation. Adverse reactions were minor and subsided within a few hours; no long term or serious adverse reactions were recorded.

The meta-analysis provided a few concessions – first that there were only four studies totaling 117 participants. There was a high risk of bias, including the fact that all participants must have been willing to take a Schedule I substance, and that three of the four studies involved cancer patients who may not otherwise be experiencing anxiety and/or depression. There was also limited diversity among subjects (58.25% Female, 86.33% White).

[**JAMA Psychiatry, 2020 – Alan Davis, et. al.**](https://assets-global.website-files.com/6022582598960827c7789b33/6039314ec645352a335785ab_Jama_Psychiatry_Davis_2020_Psilocybin_MDD.pdf)

This study sought out to study the effect of psilocybin therapy on patients with Major Depressive Disorder. It studied a pool of 27 participants aged 21 to 75 who all were afflicted by MDD and not currently using antidepressant medications. There was also a focus on cancer patients and other treatment-resistant cases of MDD. The participants were split into two groups of immediate treatment and 8-week delayed treatment.

Ultimately, the study found statistically significant improvements in the clinically evaluated MDD among the participants including half of them in remission by week 4 of the study. The study compared the efficacy of Psilocybin to Ketamine (an already prescribed drug) but with an effect lasting about twice as long (4 weeks versus 2 weeks for Ketamine). Psilocybin, like most psychedelics, also has a low likelihood of addiction (unlike Ketamine).

The study posits that this method of therapy could also be useful for treating a variety of psychiatric conditions including substance abuse disorders.

Although the science is still relatively young, Psilocybin shows positive results in a variety of studies, and has done so for a number of years. What is left is to harness the power of this drug the way we need it to be used.

**3.** **The Cybin Approach (Development Pipeline)**

Not a lot of analysis in this section, but to continue setting the stage here is Cybin’s “three-pillar” approach to drug development –

*1. Novel Drug Discovery Platform - API Modification*

Develop new APIs via selective modifications of tryptamine and phenethlyamine-based scaffolds specifically to alter their pharmacokinetics without modifying their therapeutic potential. (Changing the way drugs move through the body without reducing their effects)

Modifications involve replacing selective hydrogens with deuterium atoms.

Optimizing unique physicochemical attributes e.g. salts, crystal forms, co-crystals, etc.

Pillar One is all about discovering and creating compounds for more efficient drug design.

*2. Proprietary Drug Delivery Systems – Research and Develop*

Efficient delivery system that attempts to bypass the liver metabolism with a direct path to the brain providing faster onset (sublingual distribution).

Modified-release formulations with the potential to reduce side effects and to control exposure.

Dose control through proprietary device platform.

Delivery systems may be applied to many psychedelic compounds.

Pillar Two is all about controlling the way the isolated compound is administered, allowing for varying dosages and reliable medication times – this way patients can get the therapeutic effects of Psilocybin without feeling “high” and being potentially incapacitated for several hours.

*3. Innovative Treatment Regimen – Science Meets Technology*

Software-based platform to gather clinical research data from psychedelic treatment.

Machine learning-based data analytics for improved patient outcomes. 

Patient therapy and integration support.

Pillar Three is all about leveraging technology and data analysis to create effective drugs and treatment plans. This is where they will utilize their partnership with tech startup Kernel, who has created “Flow” – a non-invasive brain monitoring interface. Kernel Flow is like a motion-capture helmet for the head, but utilizes over 1000 sensors to monitor, image, and record precise brain activity with a rate of 200 samples per second. This data will be used to create patient-specific treatment plans.

**4.** **Achievements and In-Progress**

In this section we won’t bother to address superfluous awards or honorary mentions, but instead will focus on actual business activities.

So far they have 15 patent filings, including international patents, which cover a variety of things including novel psychedelic compounds, integration of delivery platforms, methods of use in psychiatric indications, and the drug discovery pipeline of modified and novel ergolines, tryptamines, and phenethylamines. There over 50 molecules covered by these patents.

On the drug development side, there are currently 4 active drug programs –

CYB003-005 cover three drugs who are being designed to respectively treat alcohol abuse, anxiety disorders, and the last to be used for general psychiatry and neurology. These three are still in their pre-clinical phases.

CYB001 is the flagship drug, isolated and modified psilocybin in a sublingual (under-the-tongue) film delivery used to treat Major Depressive Disorder. CYB001 is intended to begin Phase IIA trials by the end of this year, to be followed up with Phase IIB. In the clinical trial system, Phase I provides small doses to subjects and they are observed for extreme side effects or other danger. While completion of Phase I does not necessarily mean the drug is effective, it shows that in a controlled setting the drug is safe to use – and several participants still report positive effects. In Phase II, a larger group of people are split into various treatment groups with varying levels of drug dosage. Placebos are not used in Phase IIa. Phase II will verify that the drug works to some extent, will provide effective data on proper dose ranging (i.e. finding ideal minimum and maximum doses), and will also potentially reveal less-common adverse effects. So long as Phase II still indicates the drug is safe and possibly effective, the drug will move to Phase III which involves the intense scrutiny of double-blind studies, placebos, etc. and is the final phase before being released to market.

In CYB001 Phase IIa, 40 patients will evenly split into treatment groups to be given dosages in the range of 1mg, 3mg, 5mg, 7mg, and 25mg. Phase IIb will examine a group of 120 patients, 80 of which will receive a dose based on the data from IIa, and the remainder will receive a placebo. Phase II will take a total of 12 months, so a Phase III would not be expected until at least 2023, with probably 2024 being the year brought-to-market assuming everything goes well.

CYB003 and 004 are “near” human studies, but no estimated date yet. 

**5.** **Other Notes**

This write-up could really be miles long, but I definitely don’t have the discipline for that. I’m not a financials guy, so I couldn’t tell you much about how they’re doing in this startup phase of the company. So far, the company has managed to raise around C$120M.

The team at Cybin is diverse which includes: the former Ontario Health Minister, the former COO of Loblaws, Canada’s largest food and drug retailer, investment banking experience involving the execution of billions of dollars’ worth of mergers and acquisitions, experienced “new age drug” investment with previous work in cannabis startups, decades of experience in the healthcare industry, and much more.

Obviously, the biggest risk to investing in this company is that they cannot create an approved drug, or it just isn’t that effective. This however does create a large upside, and at around $2.10/share, there is potential to even have a 2x bagger just on news that they’re moving to Phase III trials. An actual drug may be able to bring 4-5x returns by around 2024-25.",1,Sharing Research on Cybin (CYBN) - A New Psychedelic Pharma Company

A Wave of Deflation

Cathie Wood: Next Big Risk Is Deflation
The underlying assumption out there is that we’re in an inflationary period turbocharged by supply-chain disruptions. I’ve seen a lot of markets and started in the business during the ’70s. I was in college when inflation was raging. So I know what that is. And I truly believe we’re not going back there and that anyone planning for it is probably going to be making some mistakes.

Instead, we see three major deflationary forces brewing.

On the innovation side, we’re in a period today like we’ve never been in. You have to go back to the telephone, electricity and automobile to see three major technologically enabled sources of innovation evolving at the same time. Today, we have five platforms: DNA sequencing, robotics, energy storage, artificial intelligence and blockchain technology — all of which are deflationary.

In artificial intelligence, training costs are dropping by 68% per year. What does that mean? We’re going to see a boom in a lot of products that use AI and therefore are better, cheaper, faster and more creative. 

There’s also DNA sequencing costs. To sequence the first whole human genome, it took $2.7 billion and 13 years of computing power. That was 2003. Eighteen years later, we’re down to $500 and a few hours of computing power. For every cumulative doubling in the number of whole human genomes sequenced, costs drop 40%. 

This is going to transform health care, helping us discern which health-care dollars we’re wasting. And we think more than half of all health-care dollars are wasted today.

Then we have electric vehicles and battery pack system technology. For every cumulative doubling in electric vehicles sold, those costs dropped by 28% for the battery, which means the EV costs are going to be dropping roughly 15% every time we see a doubling in sales and we’re in electric vehicle sales infancy right now. Another is industrial robots. Those costs are also dropping more than 20% for every cumulative doubling.

The good news is that this is good deflation, which causes a boom in economic activity, at least where the innovation is taking place.

The corollary to this is bad deflation. Since the tech and telecom bust and the ’08-’09 financial meltdown, there’s been a significant increase in risk aversion in the market. And so many investors and analysts invest very closely to their benchmarks. They don’t want to stray much.

The problem is this innovation is going to be very disruptive to the traditional world order. So the benchmarks today are constructed based on companies’ past successes. But if disruptive innovation is evolving to such a rapid extent, there’s going to be disintermediation and disruption. Companies that have learned to satisfy short-term shareholders — who want their profits and want them now — have been leveraging up to buy back shares and pay dividends.

Companies haven’t been investing enough in innovation, and we’re going to see a lot of carnage out there increasingly during the next five to 10 years. At the beginning of the S&amp;P 500 indexes initiation, the average lifespan of a company was 100 years. We believe it’s down to a little over 20 years now — but it’s going to collapse going forward.

We’re also seeing some interesting signals in cyclicals. 

Lumber prices shot up last year because of all the remodeling and demand for new homes in suburbs. Prices went to $1,700 and that’s down to $600 now. And a lot of people find that hard to believe because housing still seems so hot. I think it’s a leading indicator that prices probably went a little too far, too fast. 

Consumers feel their purchasing power is going down. Prices of goods and services are moving faster than incomes are increasing. So there’s another reason we’re probably going to see a slowdown. 

But even more important is what has happened with supply chains. If you looked at how businesses were positioned before the coronavirus, they’d been pulling back on inventory building and capital spending for about a year to 18 months. And the reason was the U.S.-China trade war, saber rattling, fear of the conflict blowing up in some way. When the coronavirus hit, businesses that had already been cautious slammed on the brakes. And what did the consumer do? The consumer started — after a month or so with the PPP payments — to stimulate the economy. They started spending because their savings rate in the previous few months had skyrocketed.

Businesses were caught flat-footed, and they’re still caught flat-footed. They haven’t been able to catch up. Inventory liquidation in the second quarter was near record-breaking levels. And so what I believe is happening now is businesses, in order to catch up, have been double- and triple-ordering. That’s what happened with lumber prices and why the decline has been so steep since mid-May. And once they see prices coming down, they’ll pull back on those orders. So I think there could be a big drop in commodity and other prices as the consumer has shifted from consuming goods, which are only a third of consumption to consuming services, just as businesses are scrambling aggressively.

Mohamed El-Erian: Inequality Creates Next Big Risk
What worries me the most is inequality, both within and across countries. And it’s something that financial markets puts aside as a social problem, not really an economic or financial problem. And we’ve risked seeing the issue of inequality gather momentum. Covid has already been the great un-equalizer, but rather than go back to where we’ve come from, we are now creating the dynamics for inequality to worsen and to assume greater importance in disrupting all sorts of things in our society.

A highly unequal society is not an economic healthy society. But the thing that worries me even more than that is inequality of opportunity. We know what Covid did to people who had no WiFi at home, who had no computers. We know that public school districts lost touch with a lot of their students and these students were not only becoming unemployed, but unemployable, which means a lost generation of young people.

As we slowly emerge from Covid, its aftermath creates different dynamics around the world. If you’re in a developing country today, you can no longer assume that companies will come to you. The onus is increasingly on you coming to the employer. And that is the real issue when education is lagging, when technology is lagging. So I do worry that we’re going to see this massive process get larger, if we’re not careful.

We were watching a tragic movie in play mode and then Covid came along and pressed fast-forward. First, it worsened wealth inequality because the response to Covid involved massive Federal Reserve liquidity injections to boost asset prices. And who owns assets? It’s the rich. So if you look at what has happened, the top part of the wealth distribution, people are much better off than they were before Covid. But at the bottom end, that hasn’t happened.

Think of people whose jobs have been displaced by this big step toward digitalization, who have no financial assets to begin with and don’t benefit from what has happened to asset prices. In addition, they are hoping to buy a house and they’ve been priced out of the housing market. So suddenly both the actual and potential wealth and income has declined.

To add to that, if they are unemployed, there’s suddenly a skills mismatch. There are record levels of vacancies that the labor market is not able to match to workers. And then you get what economists called multiple equilibria: one bad outcome, resulting not in mean reversion, but a high likelihood of an even worse outcome.

We already know what it looks like because we’ve had a taste of it. On the economic side, it looks like insufficient aggregate demand, which is a fancy way of saying that as the rich capture more income and more wealth, they spend less of it. The poor tend to consume more. So if the incremental income and wealth all go to the rich, then you’re going to have the problem of demand, which means you’re going to have a problem of growth.

And we’ve already had a period of so-called secular stagnation, and what my colleagues and I call the new normal, where we get low and insufficiently inclusive growth. We know what that looks like. We know the social consequences. It is cultural war. It’s alienation. It’s marginalization. That’s not good for society. It eats away at the fabric of society.

We know what it looks like politically. People will become single-issue voters, and single-issue voters can be captured by all sorts of things. No wonder we’re seeing an increase in populism across the world. And then it means a less equal world. You know, I grew up interested in developing countries, and for decades it was almost an accepted fact — not a hypothesis, almost an accepted fact — that these countries would converge to the advanced economies.

Well guess what? We’re having divergence going on right now. And I suspect this divergence is not short term. So we may live in a less equal world, or to be more blunt, a much more unequal world. And that’s problematic for global economic policy coordination, interdependency, immigration. I mean, I can go on and on. So it is problematic. We’ve had a taste of it and we don’t quite like that taste, but it could become a lot worse.

The American dream is all about capturing these amazing opportunities and being able to go right up the income ladder. There’s a correct notion that inequality can incentivize people to work harder, to do better, but there comes a point when it goes from encouraging people to do good things to actually detracting from not just economic well-being, but social and political well-being.

I don’t think the American dream is dead. I think it’s harder to achieve. If you don’t have the right education to begin with, if you don’t have a set of assets to begin with, you’re looking at a much steeper curve, and that is a real problem for too many people.

The prescription is investing in human and physical infrastructure. It’s about enabling people to do more and to do better. It’s about providing people with transformational opportunities. It starts at a very early age, at pre-K, exposing bright minds to exciting education and opportunities. It continues throughout the middle school, high school, university, making elite universities more accessible to people who deserve to be there but may be held back because they come from the wrong zip code or because their parents have never had an education.

There’s a lot that can be done. It’s about fundamentally asking the question, ‘How do we enable our resources, human and physical, to be more inclusive and more productive?’

Scott Minerd: Unprotected Financial Network Is Next Big Risk
The No. 1 one risk is the sustainability of the global payment system. And I choose the word sustainability over the word vulnerability, because the real key here is keeping the global payment system running, and we’ve had so many hacks, terrorist attacks, the Colonial Pipeline incident. It would appear that we are extremely vulnerable to having an attack against the payment system of the financial markets — and not just here in the U.S., but in Europe.

What I’m talking about is things like the Fedwire, where the banks’ money clears through. But also something like the DTCC, SWIFT, Euroclear. I mean, I can just keep going on and on and on. And if there was a synchronized attack, we would essentially bring the global financial market to its knees. The first response would probably be that securities prices would crash, and the second is we would probably have to close all the exchanges in the world in order to figure out how to restore the global payments system.

The thing that bothers me about the global payment system is, I don’t think anyone’s focused on it. And this really takes a high degree of international cooperation. It takes a real macro look, meaning there needs to be somebody or some group of people looking at how everything interconnects and where the potential vulnerabilities are.

I would put the probability [of it happening] as very high. Certainly well over 50%. I got accused once when talking about this that I’m actually alerting terrorists and other governments on how to attack us. But the likelihood is they’re already thinking about it.

With the Fed, when I speak to them, they don’t really comment on it. And there’s two interpretations to that: They just don’t think it’s that serious, or they believe it’s so serious that they don’t really want to say anything. Just as we found out with the electric grid, one vulnerability is that the system isn’t hardened enough and we need to harden it for security reasons. The payment system is the same sort of thing. Even though the Fedwire has been modernized over time, it’s still built off an infrastructure that’s extremely old.

We need international cooperation to assess the risk and figure out how we can harden the system that exists in the short run and, in the long run, modernize it. Delivery versus payment, which is the standard way that we’ve delivered securities for 100 years, is in an age like ours, kind of ridiculous. There’s no reason why that just can’t be instantaneous.

But that’s going to take a new generation of technology and whether that’s blockchain or whatever, it needs to be modernized. But in the short run, central banks, exchanges and so forth need to take a hard look at their systems, not just their system, but at the interconnectivity of the system and how secure is that connection that’s being made. Not just from the standpoint of it having being disrupted, but since you’re sending information through the ether, what’s the chance that that can be redirected somewhere.

Certainly, the internet’s vulnerable, right? One of the comments I made to people about cyber cryptocurrency in general is: Why do I need to transact through the internet? Why can’t I just text it to you?

There are other ways to transfer things through the ether, right? So for instance, if you look at crypto as an example, the weak link is the fact that it’s linked to the internet. Even if the blockchain was forever and perfect and hardened and you couldn’t steal from it — which is not true — if you pull the internet down, you’re done.

The U.S. government will play a huge part in [creating a new system] just because we are the financial center of the world. However, to quote Winston Churchill, the U.S. government will always do the right thing after it’s exhausted every other option. So, I don’t think they’re going to go there right away. I think that there’ll be a lot of patches.

trueconviction,"I will be offering what I hope are a few constructive suggestions for folks looking to grow their money at outsized returns with minimal risk.


There is a catch, of course. These methods involve both labor and are capped by scale. The good news is scale is very high relative to most people's net worth, and labor or time
is a commodity that can be managed and sometimes outsourced.


The most classic example is the intrinsic purchasing power of cash. When you buy in bulk typically your unit price generates savings. The more cash one has on hand, the more they
have the ability to buy a good or service at a historically low price. Every one knows this already, and this isnt very practical because such savings are really only appropriate
when buying necessities. If you are a business that has high cost of goods chances are a great deal of your focus already revolves around savings on consumables.

Every one is also already familiar with the concepts of investing in real estate, education, health, purchasing and learning to operate new tools and hardware, etc. All these things
are great and typically necessitate the cultivation of skill and demand some amout of time, and can be difficult or inconsistent to predict future earnings with. Most importantly,
countless experts who know far more than me about these subjects have already written to great length about these subjects.

What I am offering to suggest here is my primary source of income, namely manufactured spending and account churning.

For account churning, the basic concept is to meet certain thresholds to acquire cash bonuses on new accounts (typically such accounts consist of checking/savings accounts, brokerage
accounts, and sportsbook/gambling accounts). For bank accounts, there is not much strategy to this other than timing your eligibility windows with various instiutions. You will need
to tie up your cash in an account for a certain minimum period of time. If you annualize the lockup period and compare it to the bonus, you will typically realize a rate of return that
is extremely high for the lack of risk. This can be scaled fairly high (many brokerages have bonus tiers extending to the 100k range for new accounts, many banks have bonuses for
deposits up to 20k, and there are hundreds of banks offering bonuses at any given time, and you can repeat this process for each SSN). If you are capable of managing a spreadsheet with a lot of accounts, this is something
you can easily sink low millions into basic account churning. Typically bonuses can be repeated every 2 years, although this will vary greatly among institutions). Be sure to 
prepare to receive a lot of 1099-INTs and 1099-MISC's for your tax year. Some people that are very experienced in account churning will further scale by offering complete account
management to friends to make use of their SSN with their permission and receive a management fee.


Here a couple of tricks and tips: 1. Make use of pre-existing tools and datapoints for tracking eligiblity criteria and opportunities. Some good places to start include
reddit.com/r/churning and doctorofcredit.com 2. For accounts requiring spending activity, buy low volatity products such as T-bills whenever possible. When on gambling sites,
make sure you have a second SSN to simultaneously bet on opposite positions for each account separately. 3. Get very familiar with the regulatory bodies for each account you use
(for example, CFPB, OCC, etc) in case you need to make a complaint or expedite the process of your bonus being awarded.


Credit card bonuses are great and require minimum capital but typically do not scale as high as bank account bonuses. reddit.com/r/churning is a good basic resource for this.
I highly recommend going after them if you understand how to manage your credit score and learn the basics of managing applications to reduce impact to your credit score.


For manufactured spending, the basic concept is to use a rewards generating credit or debit card to purchase a cash-equivalent that can be readily liquidated back to cash at 
a rate whose rewards outweigh any associated transaction costs. For a basic example, consider using an american express blue cash preferred to buy a $500 visa gift card at your local grocer.
(a cash equivalent item). The cash back rate is 6% at a grocery store and the activation fee is 1%, so you are making 5%. You liquidate the visa gift card to another cash equivalent
(such as by making a billpayment, purchasing a money order, reloading a prepaid account, making a debit card deposit to an account, etc). You then transfer this money to your bank account
to pay off your card if you didnt already just make a direct payment on your credit card. You then cycle this as much as you can. 


The annualized ROI for cycling is typically very high. For example, consider cycling an unlimited 2% cash back card such as citi double cash or spark business cash. Let's suppose
your credit limit is 10k. On day 1 of a new cycle you buy 10k of visa gift cards and liquidate in the same day. By day 3 or 4 the charge for your gift card purchases posts to your
account and you now initiate payment. On a seasoned account, payment should typically post within a couple more business days. Suppose payment posts at day 7. This is a complete cycle.
You repeat the cycle 52 times in a year. Your annualized return on your cash is easy to calculate. 10k*0.02*52=10.4k. Suppose you incurred 1% in fees. Your annualized return is 50%
for very little risk. More importantly, this can be scaled and compounded. The cash back earned can be reinvested to cycle which is the compounding part. The scale part comes from
the fact that you can easily obtain large credit limits with strong payment history and that you can prepay certain credit cards such as amex and bofa. So if you have $100M sitting,
amex will happily let you wire $100M from your bank account to them and now your card temporarily has $100M available to spend. This is just one example. There are many ways to 
manufactured spend without gift cards (the liquidation outlets mentioned above such as such as by making a billpayment, purchasing a money order, reloading a prepaid cardaccount,
 making a debit card deposit to an account are often also simultaneously manufactured spending outlets as well).


Another means to scale high at low margins is wholesale reselling. However it is far riskier to resell than it is to buy cash equivalents since you have to trust the creditworthiness of your
buyers and the risk of your items being lost in transit. It is very similar to manufactured spending in the sense that 100% of your revenue can come from cash back without
there being any sort of comission on goods sold. This is precisely also the reason why it scales so well, since costs are externalized from the buyer to the banks to the interchange
fees the banks charge the merchants. The tradeoff is your scale is extraordinarily high (you can easily sink hundreds of millions of dollars into wholesale reselling)
and profit margins are often higher.



I hope this post inspires fellow investors to consider alternatives beyond equities. With a little skill and creativity, you can recreate ROI generating machines whose risk
and consistently you can directly control. If you have ideas and things that work well for you kindly consider sharing your knowledge for others here as well :)",1,The best investments are hiding in plain site

utradea,"Hey Everyone,

I wanted to share an analysis of why individual investors have an advantage over institutional investors and can beat the market. Would love to hear your feedback and thoughts.

# Introduction

Imagine you’re a new investor who just downloaded a brokerage app. Now image you’re in charge of an actively managed fund with a team of PhDs working for you. Both of these parties are planning on actively managing their portfolios by selecting individual stocks or bonds. Which one is going to generate higher returns? The answer probably seems pretty clear. If there’s any amount of inefficiency in the market worth taking advantage of it’s going to be captured by those with the most resources and the best education, right?

Wrong, which is what makes the stock market great. There are five key advantages individuals have compared to intuitional investors and passive funds.

1. *Individual investors won’t be fired after a few bad quarters*
2. *Access to information has never been greater, and is free in most cases*
3. *As an individual investor, time is on your side*
4. *Smaller account sizes provide more freedom*
5. *Individual investors can take greater risks*

We will dive into this in more detail, but first let’s look at a bit of history.

Advocates of passive index investing are quick to point out that passive funds have beaten active funds 86% of the time over the past 20 years \[1\]. Between 1991 and 1996 it was a tossup with active funds winning three years and losing three others \[2\]. That time frame was chosen so that we can have a fair comparison later on. In more recent memory, passive funds have won every year since 2013 with no signs of letting up. People quickly conclude that if actively managed funds with teams of PhDs can’t outperform a market index consistently that it must be nearly impossible for a retail investor to do so. This comparison sounds pretty logical on the surface but doesn’t look into the differences between the two groups.

**Retail investors can skip the management fees, can’t be fired for underperforming, are able to invest in a wider range of companies, and can take on as much risk as they want.**

Armed with these advantages retail investors outperformed market weighted index funds 49% of the time before fees from 1991 to 1996, almost the exact same rate as the active funds \[3\]. If you include fees that number drops to 43%. However, many modern brokerages no longer have fees to place orders. Both sides have advantages and disadvantages when compared to the other. This race is a lot closer than most people think.

# Individual Investors Aren’t Fired for A few Bad Quarters

If you’re a fund manager who decides to go a little outside of the box and ends up buying a lot of stocks that aren’t part of the S&amp;P 500 you could run into an issue. Let’s say those stocks you picked ended up doing really poorly this year while the S&amp;P did fine. Managing this fund is your job. If you don’t do well you could be removed from your position. Maybe they let one bad year slide, but could you underperform your peers for two years? How about three? At some point you’re going to get fired. The retail investor could underperform for a decade and still come out on top. The market is very cyclical and some popular and reliable strategies just don’t work for years at a time. Take value investing during the last decade as an example. The market has been dominated by highly valued growth stocks. Even if you carefully selected strong value stocks you would probably not be above the S&amp;P 500 during this period. Despite this, value stocks have outperformed growth stocks by an average of 4.54% per year since 1928 \[4\].

# Information has Been Democratized – Institutions are Still Paying

When you have a team of PhDs working for you to help select your stocks you have to pay them. You also need to pay yourself, pay for the office, and for any other resources you use during the selection process. These costs are going to be passed onto the investors of the fund in the form of management fees.

***These fees often cost between 0.5% and 1% annually \[5\].***

This piece is taken each year whether the fund does well or not. This means that even if the retail investor and the fund held the exact same stocks the retail investor would come out ahead.

# Time is on Your Side

Any active fund is going to be extra aware of their quarterly and annual goals. They’re going to be frequently rebalancing to meet certain requirements whether it be a risk level, an amount of diversification, or a reevaluation of their pick’s financials \[6\].

A retail investor can hold a single stock for 40 years if they believe in the long term future of the business. Let’s say both the retail investor and the fund bought Apple at the same time 20 years ago. Apple has grown an insane amount during this time frame. As one stock outpaces the rest it starts to take up a larger and larger portion of your portfolio.

The fund would likely end up selling some of their shares to bring the size of their Apple holding back in line with the rest. This also lowers their exposure to the tech sector which they would also want to keep at a certain level. The retail investor on the other hand has no such limit. He can buy it and hold it until he retires.

# Size Matters But Individual Investors Can Use it Wisely

The average retail investor is buying thousands of dollars of stock at most. The average fund is buying hundreds of thousands of dollars and often millions. This is important for a few reasons. Thousands of dollars will not have any effect on the price of most stocks whereas a million dollars can move a sizeable company. The more money being invested the more it can push the price. When you are buying tons of shares the price is going to creep upwards as you look for more and more sellers. This means that the more you buy the worse your average entry price will be. The same thing happens when you sell. Unloading millions of dollars in shares is going to drop the price which means you get a poor exit price as well. The retail trader does not have to deal with this and will have better prices on both ends which leads to better performance, even if the same stocks are picked!

The size of the investment doesn’t only affect the prices you get, it also influences what you can even attempt to buy in the first place. Some publicly traded companies have market caps of 50 million or less. It’s just not feasible for huge funds to be buying into these companies. If a fund ever buys so much of a company that it owns 5% it will need to register that with the SEC and is forced to file beneficial own reports \[7\]. The retail trader will never run into this issue.

# Individual Investors Can Use Risk to Their Advantage

We’ve seen a few reasons why funds tend to stick the S&amp;P 500 companies. We’ve also seen that they are surprisingly risk averse. Whether it be buying smaller companies, having a more concentrated portfolio, or making use of derivatives like long term call options, the retail investor has the ability to take on as much risk as they want.

If you’re familiar with the statistics behind optimized betting you’ll know what the Kelly Criterion is. In short, it’s a way to determine the optimal size bet you should take\*\*.\*\*

**The Kelly Criterion says that you should be holding a little more than 200% in the S&amp;P 500 for maximum returns, at least historically \[8\].**

This is a heavily leveraged and high risk account but was able to survive both the Dot Com Bubble and the 2008 Financial Crisis. Despite higher returns in the long term this portfolio underperforms the market for years after each crash. This makes it unrealistic for a fund manager to try to execute, but if you can handle the risk it’s an option available to every retail investor who has a long time horizon.

# Final Thoughts: If Managed Properly, These Advantages Allow Individual Investors to Beat the Market

It’s true that most actively managed funds do not outperform their passive counterparts. This is often used to cast doubt on the performance of retail investors. If the experts can’t outperform, how could you? Well, it turns out there are a lot of differences between billion dollar funds and some guy on his Robinhood app. A surprising amount of these differences offer the retail investor an advantage, or at the very least an additional degree of freedom. Using actively managed funds as a benchmark is incredibly misleading.

The odds are not in your favor as an average stock picking retail investor, but they’re not nearly as bad as they’re usually portrayed\*\*.\*\*

**In the same 1991-1996 study 25% of retail investors outperformed the index by 6% or more annually.**

If you dedicate the time and have good emotional control you can capitalize on these advantages most people don’t even know they have.

\----

TLDR; The individual investors has a number of advantages over institutional investors and can beat the market

As a swing-trader, my favorite play is to short stocks that have recently exploded in value. For example, today, $ORN, has shot up over 30% in after-hours trading. 

When I view the statistics associated with who owns it, [I noticed that 74.6% is owned by institutions, the ""smart money.""](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/ORN/key-statistics?p=ORN)

NineteenSixtySix,"WASHINGTON/BOSTON, Sept 29 (Reuters) - The top U.S. securities regulator on Wednesday will propose requiring large hedge funds and endowments to disclose how they vote on executive pay, bringing this clutch of influential investors in line with other top funds that have made their pay votes public for a decade.

The changes proposed by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) will also include mandates for investors to provide more details about how share lending affects proxy voting and to make certain reports machine-readable, an SEC official told Reuters, speaking on condition of anonymity.

Together the changes from the Democratic-led agency are meant to bring more transparency to shareholder annual meetings, partly by implementing rules mandated by the Dodd-Frank financial reforms of 2010.

If approved by a majority of the five-member commission on Wednesday, the rule changes would be subject to a 60-day public comment period before further action.

Among S&amp;P 500 company CEOs average total pay rose 52% to $12.18 million in 2020 from $8 million a decade earlier, according to compensation consultant Farient Advisors.

Among other things Dodd-Frank mandated shareholders get the chance to cast so-called ""say-on-pay"" advisory votes on executive compensation, which have put a focus on CEO pay at many corporate annual meetings for the past decade.

The votes, combined with the disclosures that big mutual fund firms have filed since 2004 via Form N-PX, had already brought scrutiny to the biggest asset managers. read more

But SEC Democratic Commissioner Allison Lee told an industry audience in March that the Form N-PX disclosures are too unwieldy to show retail investors how their money is voted and because they currently are not filed by certain investment firms. read more

Separately, some managers have given up their rights to vote in exchange for fees when they lend out shares to short-sellers. While this can cut costs for investors, it has also changed the outcome of corporate elections, according to proxy solicitors.

Industry groups say that if the SEC's proposals prove too costly, those burdens would be passed on to fund shareholders. They also said the success of the SEC's rule change may depend on how quickly vendors can adapt to machine-readable technology.

Critics of the say-on-pay rule, including its co-author, say it did little to slow the growth of rewards for top U.S. executives.

Top asset managers still overwhelmingly back executive pay, according to new data from researcher Insightia showing that during the 12 months ended June 30 three of the largest fund firms each supported management on pay about 95% of the time, roughly the same as the prior period.

Yet, we go out of our ways to select certain brands over others - most of the time at a higher price \[1\]. Everyone knows the importance of reputation for a company. Highly reputable brands have multiple things going for them:

* Their customers are extremely loyal and drive recurring purchases
* The public is vocal about recommending their brand and products
* Easier to expand to other markets as their reputation precedes them

Basically, you can consider having a great reputation to be a positive feedback loop on steroids! In an economy where 70-80% of the market value of a company comes from intangible assets like brand equity, intellectual capital, and goodwill \[2\], reputations can make or break a company’s performance.

In one of my previous analyses, we had discovered and proved that the [best companies to work for routinely beat the market in stock returns](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ok4l9c/i_analyzed_the_performance_of_companies_in_the/). So this week, let’s see how the most reputed brands have performed over the last decade!
___
**Data**

While there are multiple companies that measure reputation, I chose the [RepTrack](https://www.reptrak.com/) list for my analysis as they seem to be the most established ones and have been creating their top 100 list for the last 2 decades.

They base their study on more than 240K responders over 15+ countries and the rating tells us how the companies are regarded by the general public. They have multiple factors that go into the final ranking, but for this analysis, I am only considering the final rank of the company.

I am considering the companies that were present in the Top 10 list at least once in the last decade \[2012 - 2021\] 
___
**Analysis**

RepTrack publishes their result in March, every year. Since I could not find any fixed date of publication, for the purpose of the stock price calculation, I am using April 1st of every year as my investment date.

Even though the company produces a Top 100 list, I have limited my analysis to the Top 10 companies \[3\]. We then calculate the stock returns generated by these companies \[4\] over various time periods (1-year, 3-years, 5-years &amp; till date) and then compare it to our benchmark. \[5\]
___
 **Results** 

**Return Comparison - SPY vs Top 10 - Most Reputable Brands** 

|Time Period|Most Reputable Brand (Avg Return)|SPY (Avg Return)|Alpha|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|1 Year|17.1%|16.2%|0.9%|
|3 Years|44.8%|41.2%|3.6%|
|5 Years|94.1%|77.9%|16.2%|
|Till Date|188.3%|136.4%|51.9%|

 

Companies in the most reputable list have consistently beaten SPY over different time periods. There is a significant improvement in overall return when holding the investment for a longer-term.

My hypothesis here is that, even though the short-term returns can be affected by market cycles, over the long run, companies having a great reputation end up outperforming their peers, and this is reflected in their stock price.

[Another interesting insight](https://preview.redd.it/shv1yw10q8q71.png?width=761&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2b85dbf0596b22f9d93bfa3f1cd954f012e9e796) we can derive from the data is the performance of the top-10 companies in each year’s list. As we can see, the most reputable brands beat SPY by a considerable margin in 7/10 years \[6\]. 
___
**Limitations to the Analysis**

There are some limitations to the above analysis that you should be aware of before trying to replicate the strategy.

* Ideally, the backtest should be done over 30-40 year’s worth of data as we would know how the changing trends would impact the analysis. The last decade or so was predominantly biased towards tech.
* One should also benchmark this against the companies having an average or poor reputation to see if reputation is indeed a distinguishing factor that is driving the returns. \[7\]
* Finally, reputation is just one factor related to the company. There are companies whose reputations are in the gutter but have produced extraordinary returns for their shareholders (Facebook gave 175% return &amp; Volkswagen gave 117% return in the last 5 years even after all the scandals they have been through). 
___
**Conclusion**

Whether you like it or not, brands seem to have a significant impact on our daily lives. Just think about the number of times you/your friend have sworn by a brand and recommended it to everyone \[8\]. Almost all the brands in the top 10 list (eg. Rolex, Ferrari, Adidas, Harley-Davidson) have users that are extremely loyal, willing to pay a premium, and acts as unofficial spokespersons for the company.

Our analysis, in turn, proves that all these positive factors cause the company to outperform the market! So now you know what to do next time when your friend is swearing by a brand.

Until next week…

\[3\] The main reason for stopping with the Top 10 is the manual data pull process. They do not give a stock ticker associated with the stock nor is the list easily parsable. Given we are pulling data for 10 years, I limited myself to the top 10 companies.

\[4\] A stock is only considered if it’s directly investable from the US market and is an independent company (Examples of companies ignored - Rolex, LEGO Group, and Bosch)

\[5\] Before you come at me with Pitchforks for using S&amp;P 500 instead of Nasdaq Composite, please take a look at the list of companies. It’s from a wide variety of industries.

\[6\] I don’t think 2020 and 2021 should be counted here due to two reasons. First, it’s not enough time as we can see from the first graph (there is very little difference in performance over 1 year period), and secondly, 2020 was one of the largest bull runs in the history of SPY.

thecrazednutter,"I am starting to think that gold is no longer a suitable inflation hedge. We are experiencing the most inflation in over 30 years right now and gold is not budging. In fact, gold is approaching pre-pandemic prices. Furthermore, real interest rates, which are interest rates that take inflation into account, are among the lowest they've been in 50 years. They were higher in the mid-70s and early-80s. Gold is not rising and maybe it is because it is a) not fashionable and b) no longer suitable for this era.

However, if inflation persists gold could still rebound. In the event of continued or above trend inflation, investor's will feel a need to find a store of value. Large institutional investors have a duty to preserve their clients' investments. They will buy anything that holds value, even if it doesn't rise much. Gold could be a logical pick because it is somewhat easy to buy and has a long track record.

Could gold still be that store of value?",1,Is gold still a store of value?
DaytonaDemon,"The Personal Advisor service at Vanguard screwed me earlier this year by making a bad mistake. I moved multiple tens of thousands of dollars in IRA money over to Vanguard from another company, with explicit instructions to the advisor team that the money be reinvested according to the agreed-upon asset allocation — in my case, about 60-65 percent exposure to U.S. stocks. Instead, the dumbasses let the sum sit and sit...in a money market account. It made exactly *nothing*. I didn't find out about that until very recently. Cost me thousands.

I had other complaints about Vanguard (talking to anybody on the advisor team required reserving a time slot literally *weeks* in advance, which is *worse* service than I got *before* I signed up for Personal Advisor). The mistake with the money transfer/reinvestment finally clinched it. I canceled the agreement, and am on my own again.

So now I have a good chunk of money sitting on the sidelines. I'm a big fan of dollar-cost averaging but that's not really an option here — I have eight or nine years till retirement and that dough has to go to work ASAP.

Connorvo,"I scraped every new performance grant CEOs received in 2017 to see if copying those trades would beat the market. The initial results are very promising (12-25% ɑlpha on average depending on the timeframe), but more research needs to be done!

# How it works:

I wrote a python script that scraped every single Form 4 filed in 2017. It was only looking for filings that matched the below criteria:

1. The grant was a Performance Grant. Performance Grants are used to reward executives with stock only if they reach certain performance targets
2. The Performance Grant targets were for the stock to reach specified price targets. This means that the executive would receive stock ***only*** if the stock hit certain price targets during the given timeframe
3. The executive receiving the grant was a CEO or President.
4. The grant was not regularly scheduled (i.e. it wasn’t a grant they would receive every year). FIltering these out makes it more likely that the grant was given because the CEO and Board of Directors have confidence that the stock can reach the price targets.

# Overall Results

These kinds of grants don’t happen very often, there were only 9 of them in 2017, but they did indeed beat the market.

Of the 9 stocks that were found, all of them peaked at a price more than 35% above the performance grant and 6 of them peaked up more than 100% in the 3 years following the grant.

The below table is the average returns by months since the performance grant for the SPY and the stocks I found.

Taking a slightly closer look at “Max Returns” in the table below, we can see it took anywhere from 141 days to 1088 days for the stocks to reach their max return since the grant. The average was \~700 days, meaning it takes about 2 years for most of the stocks to hit their peak.

You will also see that 6 of the 9 stocks reached their performance grant targets. 2 of the 3 stocks that didn’t reach their targets had insanely high targets of 160% and 260% stock returns and both of the stocks had well over 100% returns. The other target that wasn’t reached had a 58% target but was the worst-performing stock

This grant only had one vesting date, February 6, 2020, but the grant would vest if it hit the price targets at any point between the grant date and February 6, 2020. The stock had vesting targets at $11, $14, and $18. The stock fell about 14% over the next 2.5 months before then popping up to $10.20 (37% return) about 5 months after the grant date. The stock then had a looooong fall for the next \~1.5 years until February 6, 2020. The stock recovered and reached all the way up to $15 after COVID, but the performance grant had already expired so they never received any of the awards.

The grant could begin vesting immediately and they had 2.5 years to reach the goal. The stock price immediately started going up after the performance grant and reached a local maximum of $10.55 (85% return) 4 months after the initial grant before spending the next year and a half going down to below $7. This grant was an all-or-nothing grant where the price had to reach $16 within 2.5 years to vest. It never reached that goal but maxed out at $12.53 (120% return) about 2 years after the initial grant.

# FAQs / Concerncs

***What is a Form 4?***

A Form 4 is filed any time an executive at a public company buys, sells, or is granted stock. They are required to file with the SEC within 3 days of taking the action

***Why did you pick 2017?***

Most performance grants have a timeline that is 3 years or shorter (though some are up to 5 years). 2017 ensures enough time has passed for the grant to actually play out

***Where did you get the data?***

The SEC has a database (EDGAR) that lets you scrape all of the info from all of the SEC filings

***Why did you pick the timeframes you chose (1 month, 3 months, 6 months, 12 months, 18 months, 24 months, 30 months, 36 months)?***

No particular rhyme or reason. I felt like these gave a pretty good overview of the short, medium, and long-term returns for each grant.

***9 stocks aren’t very many***

True. The sample size is very small. I am in the process of doing the analysis for more years to increase this number, but the number will never get very large as these types of grants don't happen super often.

**This isn't adjusted for risk in any way**

This is also true. These stocks vary from small to large market cap and have different levels of volatility which can affect the returns on a risk-adjusted basis. It may be worth diving into risk adjustments at some point, but right now I want to focus on gathering more data and seeing if there are any potentially viable investment strategies around the data.

# Takeaways

I definitely think this is promising, but the hard part is putting it into action. Obviously, if we could see the future and sell at the max price for all of the stocks, we’d all make millions, but the stocks don’t all just go up and to the right.

Some of them fall before popping, some pop and then fall, some pop then fall then pop even more.

There is potentially a viable strategy involving holding the stocks until they reach some return threshold (maybe like 25%) and then letting it run with a stop-loss, but I think I need more data to build better strategies. I will work on gathering more data.",1,Can you beat the market by copying CEO Performance Grants? It looks like you might!

ini0n,"I don't expect this to be super popular but I want to make it as a record to say I called it. 

The good times are almost up. 

Here's a long wall of text, don't apologise for it, no TLDR. Don't expect anyone to read this anyway.

--- **Everything depends on treasury bonds and inflation** ---

Don't look at the S&amp;P as a PE ratio, but as a yield, so it's 1:1 with bonds. For example the S&amp;P 500 has a 34.75 PE - in earnings yield 2.9% a year. The ratio between treasuries and the S&amp;P 500 is called BEER (bond equity earnings yield ratio). 

Currently a 10 year US treasury yields 1.4% and S&amp;P 2.9%. The yield on a treasury can't exceed stocks in the long run, who would buy stocks if they could do better in risk free bonds. S&amp;P comes with risk premium due to downturns. 

Treasury yield are near all-time lows due to a number of factors including COVID and the fed printing $120b/month to buy securities. Low treasury yields make S&amp;P look more attractive, driving up the price and down the yield. 2.9% is better then 1.4%.

This relationship between treasuries, inflation and stock yields determines *everything.*

Money supply has expanded rapidly due to massive printing. M1 massively, M2 slightly so far. As the velocity of money increases with reopening it guarantees M2 expansion.

https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/M1SL

https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/M2SL

Wages are up, commodity prices are up which in conjunction with massive money printing *guarantees* inflation will at the very least run hotter then it was pre-2020 for an extended period of time. How hot... who knows? In 2019 it was 1.8%, so at a minimum we're looking at 2%, probably higher. Not hyper-inflation but hotter then before. This is a certainty. 

--- **The debt burden** ---

The government funds itself with treasuries and so the yield it has to pay is a major deal. The US has $29t in debt, at a 1.4% yield that's $400b/year in interest payments. Manageable. At 14%, as it was in the 80s, that's $4t a year, almost as much as the entire yearly $6.5t budget. Unmanageable. 

This massive debt expansion gives very little room for the fed to manoeuvre, which makes it very predictable. The fed *cannot* allow inflation run too hot as it would bankrupt America. 

Given a choice between crashing the market and inflation it will crash the market. It does not have the option to do anything else, it cannot let yields rise significantly. 

--- **So what does this mean for stocks?** ---

Remember: Inflation rate &lt; Treasury yields &lt; S&amp;P yields

PE ratios going up over last 30 years is not the result of investors randomly deciding stocks are worth more. It's the result of low inflation, therefore low treasury yields, therefore low S&amp;P yields, therefore PE going up, therefore stocks going up. 

The US economy in real terms has been barely growing, a couple percent a year at best, the massive bull run over the last decade is not a sign of economic prosperity, it's almost purely multiple expansion. We're at one end of the pendulum and now it has to swing back.  

Inflation guaranteed to go up = treasury yields guaranteed to go up = S&amp;P yield guaranteed to go up (PE ratio going down). 

The yield on a treasury can't trail inflation significantly and historically has sat above inflation. There are less buyers for something guaranteed to lose purchasing power every year. 

That means if inflation sits at 2.5% we're looking at treasury yields at a minimum of 3-4%. Which means S&amp;P yield (currently 2.9%) has to sit up around 5-6%. This would involve the S&amp;P losing *half* its value from relatively small absolute changes to inflation. 

Even the fed estimates inflation to be 4% in 2021 and 2% going forward which will be the absolute best case scenario. 2% inflation would still cause at least a 20% drop in stocks, probably much more.

--- **Conclusion** ---

Inflation running hotter is a mathematic certainty. Treasury yields going up is a mathematic certainty. S&amp;P PE ratio (and therefore stock price) coming down is a mathematic certainty. 

The fed can choose to either fight inflation and crash the market, or let inflation run free and support the market. It will mostly choose the former, however we will see a bit of both. Inflation will run hotter then expected and stocks will fall.

The market won't crash all at once bar some unforeseeable event, this won't happen overnight, it will gradually wheeze down as treasury yields adjust to the asset purchase taper and inflation ticking up. I am naming the upcoming event **""The Great Wheeze""** and I expect everybody to call it this.

The underlying economy will keep ticking along relatively normal as before, so barely growing in real terms, but stocks will spend years in decline as treasury yields rise. People will recommend 60/40 stock/bond portfolios again. If you are looking to work in investment banks ask to join the bond division. 

I predict this will start within 12 months, probably accelerate early-mid next year and continue. 

--- **Is there a way to make money from this?** ---

The problem with everything bubbles is there's less opportunity. Almost everyone is going to take a hit.

Diversify away from US stocks, invest in low PE foreign markets with high underlying growth to counteract PE compression. Economies that aren't to dependant on exporting to the US is best. We're at the cusp of a new era in investment that will be defined by international markets. Commodity and defensive value stocks with decent dividends are probably solid.

The other option is to hedge with 20-40% of your portfolio. Hedge against treasury yields going up (hello Burry) and the market going down. Goofy valuation stocks will fall the most. The problem is the market can stay irrational for extended periods of time.

Holding cash is ok, but inflation will start to eat into its purchasing power. There's not going to be a sudden dip and then rebound, it will wheeze out for years, as it's not caused by some temporary recoverable event like COVID or the GFC, it's caused by the economic equivalent of gravity.  

The other option is markets don't collapse in uniform. Typically there's a cascade of collapse that starts at fringe markets and heads inwards towards the core. If you're holding stocks pre-collapse, selling them and buying in sectors that have already collapsed is another play.

Best of luck fellas, catch you on the other side.",1,The Great Market Wheeze is almost upon us
informedFinancials,"&gt; Despite standard investment advice to the contrary, individuals often engage in panic selling, liquidating significant portions of their risky assets in response to large losses.Using a novel dataset of 653,455 individual brokerage accounts belonging to 298,556 households, we document the frequency, timing, and duration of panic sales, which wedefine as a decline of 90% of a household account’s equity assets over the course of onemonth, of which 50% or more is due to trades. We find that a disproportionate numberof households make panic sales when there are sharp market downturns, a phenomenonwe call ‘freaking out’. We show that panic selling and freakouts are predictable andfundamentally different from other well-known behavioral patterns such as overtradingor the disposition effect. Investors who are male, or above the age of 45, or married, orhave more dependents, or who self-identify as having excellent investment experience orknowledge tend to freak out with greater frequency. We use a five-layer neural networkmodel to predict freakout events one month in advance, given recent market conditionsand an investor’s demographic attributes and financial history, which exhibited truenegative and positive accuracy rates of 81.5% and 69.5%, respectively, in an out-of-sample test set.

_qqqq,"So I've been an oil investor for a long time, sure things are good right now, but I've got this little voice gnawing away at me more and more causing me to question if I should slowly move more and more out of O&amp;G to some other basic resources or will I miss out on COVID recovery gains if I lose focus.  


There is no doubt O&amp;G is still going to be here for a long time: aircraft still need fuel, transport trucks aren't going fully electric anytime soon, plastics and other oil based products aren't going to be replaced by synthetics in the neat term.   


Obviously EVs are the big one that has the capacity to put a dent in global oil consumption, but they are still a long way off from being truly affordable to the masses and we're missing critical infrastructure to support them. There is no way I'm personally even interested in an EV until refueling is a 5 minute affair and there is enough public charging infrastructure to not have to wait in lines on busy travel weekends.   


So I can convice myself O&amp;G still has PLENTY of runway left, especially in the wake of COVID, but then I see things like Porsche's [synthetic fuel](https://www.caranddriver.com/news/a35577611/porsche-synthetic-efuel-clean-emissions-testing/), non-petroleum based plastics, and some of the majors leaving some high value oil fields and diversifying into non OG based markets, causing me to think maybe I need to diversify more or at least quicker than I was planning to.  


Things like base metals for EV batteries, uranium for clean energy (if everyone can get past the 3 Mile Island mentaltiy) and rate Earth metals are catching my interest more and more.

scarberia123,"Panic selling is common after stock market dips, and it’s more likely to happen with certain investors, according to research from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.

When the market drops, men who are over age 45, or are married with children or have self-described “excellent investment experience” are more prone to sell-offs, the research shows. 

“These are significant drivers of panic selling,” said co-author Chi Heem Wong, researcher at MIT. And many who leave the stock market don’t return, thereby missing out on recoveries.

While the study doesn’t uncover why some investors may be more vulnerable to emotional selling, financial experts say the findings raise further questions about how these factors — gender, age, marriage and family — affect behavior.

The research suggests these sellers have emotional overreactions defined by their decisions having the opposite of the intended effect, said Amanda Clayman, a financial therapist in Los Angeles. 

“Clearly, these are people who are trying to protect themselves,” she said.

While most investors are vulnerable to emotional choices, the findings from MIT align with other research showing men may be more prone to acting on their impulses. 

“Women are not as likely to take a huge decisive action like this because they’re not quite sure that their impulse or their feeling is correct,” Clayman said.

Men are 35% more likely to trade investments than women, according to a study from Fidelity, and trying to time the market often leads to lower performance. 

Moreover, those trading to achieve stability during volatile periods often see the opposite results, another study from the University of British Columbia finds. 

Control bias
Some males face pressure from an early age to “figure it out themselves,” which may trigger a control bias, or thinking that can influence results when they can not, said certified financial planner Teresa Bailey, wealth strategist at Waddell &amp; Associates in Nashville, Tennessee.  

“They sometimes feel that if they know enough about a subject, they should be able to control the outcome,” she said. “Unfortunately, there are far more variables at play when attempting to time the market.”

And once these investors get lost, it can be tough to seek guidance if they feel it’s their role to solve the problem on their own, she said.

Checks and balances
As humans primed with survival instincts, it can be challenging to avoid “fight or flight” responses like hitting the sell button when stocks plummet, Clayman said.

However, someone possibly more susceptible to panic selling may want to create a system of checks and balances, such as calling a peer or discussing the decision with a partner, she said, to protect themselves from emotional responses.

“We are not very accurate at assessing our actual threat response when we think about it ahead of time,” Clayman said. “Most of us freak out way more than we think.”

Chewy - been getting hammered the last month or so, not a had spot to add some considering they have a strong business model and seem to be well positioned for any future covid scare scenarios or even just a strong reopening of the economy, win win imo

Intel - how is this not undervalued ? I understand Amd and Nvda have taken some market share for themselves and the deal with Apple ended last year, aside from this I believe the company is solid and should not be trading anywhere near the p/e it currently is 

Dell - seems like a solid move with the 5 bil buyback taking place, technicals are strong 

Mrk - Merck and Co seems a bit undervalued and the technicals are showing buy, nice dividend, slow mover but nice for the long term

Yeti Holdings - liking the breakdown we are seeing and I will be waiting for the right time to add this one, love their products, low p/e, nice strong trend, what is not to like ???? Maybe they should merge with crox and run together!!!! 

AbbVie - I like the weekly chart coming back down to the 50 ma for a buy, looks like a big cup and handle forming, adding this along with AZN 

Docusign - any dips I'm buying 

Afrm - swinging for new highs, technicals are strong, looking for a breakout very soon

bestzec,"Let’s start with the elephant in the room. Generics…

Wait no, the company debt

Wait actually, the opioid lawsuits

Okay there is a room full of elephants and we’re over the weight limit so let’s let them out one at a time.

**Generics:**

As everyone and their deceased great grandmother likes to point out, margins for generics are thin. However, fast food margins are thin too but we still get Mickey D’s and Wendy’s all the time and they are doing well. Thin margins may be a barrier to navigate around, but it does not prevent success if the overall market and the company’s market share is big enough. Thin margins is a deterrent for new competition and a barrier to entry for new players in the field and an already established behemoth like TEVA will be that much harder to knock down by a newcomer. Furthermore, unlike the fast food consuming population that die early from heart disease and diabetes, preventing the overall fast food industry from growing as they lose their customers (not to mention (yes I’m mentioning it) the growing trend of eating healthily which helps my next point), the growing aging population need more and more affordable drugs (cough generics) to stay alive and performant in the bedroom. Guess which company has a super good, affordable generic viagra drug… That’s right it’s TEVA.

Viagra is clearly not the only drug I’m on right now. You guessed it, the other one is adderall, a shit ton of it. I’m popping them like tic tacs. And it’s the TEVA brand of course. As more and more people have a harder time focusing due to navigating the stresses and distractions of life in a pandemic, while competition at every aspect of life (school, work, sex life) is at an all time high, they are diagnosed with ADHD and will need generic adderall that they can afford. Theres also a more recent booming emergence for needing copious amounts of adderall as new, unexperienced traders join the stock and crypto markets to invest and lose all their money and stare at charts all day, which requires focus for a solid 8-9 hours and can only be done by means of taking a lot of adderall.

Did I mention the stress that comes from all these aspects of life? Because TEVA has a Xanax generic to help with that too. I’ll be taking that later when I’m ready to go to sleep.

Medically licensed pill prescribers are in on this too. They are raking in the dough. Just ask my psychiatrist. A 5 minute phone conversation on a monthly basis is all I need to replenish all of my prescriptions. No medical checks or anything like that needed either based on my experience. He gets paid over $500 through insurance for these 5 minute interactions. It is easy to find pill pushers to provide the licensed drugs we all know and love, and need.

Oh and if you’re not sold on that, then maybe some medical weed will help lower your guard. If you have cancer or some other disease, TEVA can provide you with some generically licensed weed to ease your pain. But bestzec, isn’t weed becoming legalized everywhere? Maybe, but it’s a slow process, and it can still take years for most states and countries to legalize it. Furthermore, even if it was legal everywhere, there are a few important things to consider. It is expensive as shit in states that legalized it. I’m talking $100s of dollars for a few edibles that may last for only a few days. They already make it expensive to begin with and then tax the shit out of it for good measure. Good luck getting enough supply for your daily needs without going bankrupt. Also, many of these dispensaries and the weed that they sell are not FDA approved and is made by unlicensed or inconsistent producers. If I’m paying $100s of dollars that weed better be good and better work. I don’t want some unmixed batch where half my chocolates are only good for cavities and the other half puts me in the hospital. If I can get a pill pusher to prescribe me some regulated weed that I know is consistent, healthy, FDA approved and has insurance covering the cost, then I would much rather do that than going bankrupt and ending up in the hospital.

Generics sales are expected to grow over 25% (With everything mentioned earlier, I expect a much higher revenue growth than 25%, but maybe that’s just from my own consumption) over the next 5 years and TEVA is one of only a few big sellers in this field. This translates to increases in billions of revenues for TEVA as a large portion of TEVA’s revenues comes from generics.

**The company debt:**

Teva has a lot of debt. Like a lot. Even more than I have in the bank. However, looking at their debt chart, they have been reducing it every year since it spiked in 2016. At this rate they can bring it back to the levels of 2015 in about 6 years. Debt is only a problem if the interest is high and you’re not making any money to pay it off, but TEVA’s revenues alone for one year are almost as much as its current debt. Now I know revenues are not profits, but if they reduce some operating expenses (which they have been trimming the fat over the past few years) as well as their generics market keeps growing, they’ll be able to reduce the debt even faster. Lastly, a point about debt in general and why it is not so bad when the interest is low (which it is especially these days). With inflation on the rise and Printer Powell setting his printers on overdrive at an exponential pace for the past few years, printing 40% of the money US has ever had in 2020 alone, covering low interest debt made at historical costs/prices gets easier as value of money is adjusted to today’s prices (This is also a reason why TEVA’s stock price decline for a decade with inflation going haywire is very suspicious). The point is that TEVA is still making a shit ton of money ($17B in 2019) and are managing and reducing their debt.

**Opioid lawsuits:**

There’s been headlines making the news about progress around these lawsuits. The bigger companies like J&amp;J are reaching settlements saying they are prepared to pay around $5 B dollars. So let’s do some ratios. If a giant company like J&amp;J, that’s worth $430 B market cap is prepared to only pay $5 B, then Teva, which is completely undervalued and only worth $10 B, should be settling for around \~ $116 M. Even if it was $0.5 B, it would still just be a drop in the bucket of their revenues and they can cover that in 1 quarter alone. Because TEVA also has debt and a low market cap, they can argue to reduce the settlement cost to a reasonable amount. They are not going to charge $TEVA with a $10 Billion dollar fine when J&amp;J which is 43 times bigger is settling for only $5 Billion.

Are there any elephants left? I’m sure there are, there always are. Or maybe the ones mentioned are still in the room. So go ahead and bring them up in the comments.

**Onwards to the valuation:**

What’s valuable? Getting into undervalued assets; not accurately valued or overvalued assets that are at or around all time high prices.

You think i’m going to suggest buying something at all time high price? hell no. Even if it is accurately valued. Not interested. Amazon at 2 Trillion dollars? Apple at 2 Trillion? FB at 1 Trillion? Any other S&amp;P 100 stock? No thanks (I know most of you probably have some of these stocks. I am not saying they should go down in value, just that at Trillions of dollars market cap maybe they are at the very least accurately valued? And less likely to 2x-5x in price in the next few years which would bring some of them to 10 Trillion dollars market cap if they do. Not to mention (again mentioning) their leadership unloading Billions of dollars in shares on current buyers. Not interested in being Bezos’s ex-wife’s bagholder as she dumps her billions, along with Bezos himself, at all time high on the vulnerable retail market).

Now looking at the price graph over the past couple decades, it’s more than likely that if you bought and held TEVA then you’re in the red. Even the one true Buffett is in the red based on when he bought his TEVAs. But have no fear Mr. Buffett, I’m coming back for you.

What I like about TEVA is that I think it is grossly undervalued based on its current and historical price and compared to other pharma companies valuations. It looks like it has been oversold for some time and this is the accumulation period. Buying it now is pretty much buying it at an all time low as it is clearly at a period of accumulation at the $8-$10 range in the past couple years. Buyers have an opportunity to get shares at a cost that people had 20 years ago, all while inflation has been rampantly ravaging the dollar. I’ve been DCAing for some time to bring my cost basis way down.

**A few finishing notes to depart with:**

Teva has also been revamping their leadership. The current CEO is a family man from Denmark and everyone likes Denmark.

There is also a lot of price manipulation happening behind the scenes. The hedge funds have strong control of the stock price so be careful of buying options and holding your call options that expire on Fridays when the price is close to a strike price. They always bring it below so the options expire worthless. They’ve been preventing breakouts upwards for some time during this accumulation period but I doubt they will hold it much longer as more and more people are accumulating.

Lastly, looking at the trend of Institutional Ownership and Shareholders that filed forms with the SEC (fintel) over the past 7 years it looks very promising as almost all the shares are now being held strong and there will be a share shortage soon for people trying to get in cheap as TEVA recovers. That’s right, this is not a short squeeze play, at least not yet. There is a lot of institutional owners, many of which are in the red, and no one wants to sell at a loss so most of them probably want to hold till at least $20. If they’ve been holding for this long, and even accumulating more, then they’ll keep holding for the price recovery.

ljstens22,"The Journal of Finance back in 2001 claimed ""companies with high R&amp;D to equity market value (which tend to have poor past returns) earn large excess returns."" We took that and set screens for backtesting at a cut-off of 15% of market cap spent on R&amp;D.  This is rare for companies to do but nonetheless it happens. 

From there we took the Russell 3000 and took out the companies that don't report R&amp;D expenses. 

Then we took out companies that had high short interest to avoid companies that analysts/funds determined were spending irresponsibly. 

Most companies that remain are health care and tech, and most are smaller. Therefore, I wouldn't build an entire portfolio around this but it's a nice addition to a portfolio. I'll be adding 5 stocks into my Roth and rebalancing each quarter, which were the backtesting criteria we used for:

\- 29.1% CAGR

\- 10.3 standard deviation of results

\- 52% high CAGR for a 3-yr increment

\- 1% low CAGR for a 3-yr increment

To get this data we took FactSet data which accounts for look-ahead and survivorship biases, and backtested it from Jan. 2000 until today. We didn't want to just do a straight 2000-2021 backtest because no one will keep a strategy going for 21 years until it pays off.   
Therefore, to backtest, we ""walked back"" 3 year tests from Sept 2021 to Sept 2018, then Sept 2018 to Sept 2015, etc. This went back to 2000.  From there we switched to Jan 2000 and walked back up to 2021 (Jan 2000-2003, '03 to '06, etc).   
Then we did this with 5 year windows (Sept. 2021 back to 2016, 2016 back to 2011, etc.) all the way to Sept. 2001, and then Jan. 2000 back up to 2020.

pdieff,"If you agree Real Rates will continue to climb (say the 10 yr reaching 1.75% as it did in March).

Examples; DDOG currently $150 PS over 50X. March price mid $80’s.  $110 Dec PUT 24% out of the money goes for $120 (in the money over $1.3K) Notice I didn’t even look for puts in the $80’s or $90’s.

“Oh there is no way any of these stocks will drop that much”. REALLY???? Are you sure?  None of them are profitable and trade and insane multiples.  And higher rates = venom to high multiple / valuation stocks.  Proof? Recent Proof? Just look at the relation of real rates and the collapse in price of all of these stocks.

TinsleyBlasingame,"Background: I enjoy researching and picking individual stocks for fun, and I have an investing account separate from my 401k/other accounts for this purpose. I see it as a sort of ""gamble"" fund, but I am by no means blowing large portions of my income with this hobby. I say this so readers are not alarmed that I am picking individual stocks as someone who has only a few years of investing experience.

As a retail investor, one thing I am confused about are stock splits (e.g., Zillow splitting into Z and ZG or Google splitting into GOOG and GOOGL). I understand that companies do this in order to create new classes of shares that can serve a variety of purposes, like allowing the company to make acquisitions, compensate executives, etc.

My question is: does it matter which version of the stock I buy? For example, if I wanted to buy stock in Zillow, is buying Z essentially the same thing as buying ZG, even if one is cheaper than the other? Will they go up or down similarly? Is there anything else I need to know about stock splits?

Unlike ICE cars and most other durable goods, EV's have a huge margin for continued cost reduction.  They will keep getting better and cheaper.   


Likewise, once the commercial truck makers break the 650 mile barrier, that sector will flip overnight.

nobjos,"There is an old saying on Wall Street.

&gt;There are many possible reasons to sell a stock, but only one reason to buy.

If you think about it, you can sell stocks for any number of reasons - downpayment for a house, a medical emergency, or just plain profit booking. But when you are using your hard-earned money to purchase a stock, there is only one reason. You expect the stock price to go up!

It’s not a hard stretch to imagine that company insiders who are in high-ranking positions (CXO’s, VP’s, Presidents, etc.) would have a better understanding of the company and its expected future performance than any financial analysts out there who are just working with publically available data. So if these well-informed insiders are making significant stock purchases, does that mean they expect the stock price to shoot up soon?

In this week’s analysis let’s put this to the test. **Can you beat the market if you follow the stock purchases made by company insiders?**

___

**Data**

The data for this analysis was taken from **openinsider.com**

it’s a free-to-use website that tracks all the trades reported on SEC Form 4 \[1\]. While there are a lot of transactions that are reported daily to the SEC, I kept the following conditions to reduce noise in the data.

* Only transactions done by CXO’s, VP’s and Presidents (people who have a significant view of the company strategy and operations) are considered.
* A minimum transaction value of 100K
* The transaction should be purchase (Not a grant, gift, or purchase due to options expiration)

The financial data used in the analysis is obtained from Yahoo Finance.

___

**Analysis**

For all the transactions, I calculated the stock price change across different time periods (One Week, 1-Month, 3-Months, 6 Months &amp; 1 Year) and then benchmarked the returns against S&amp;P500 over the same time period.

My hypothesis for choosing different time periods was to understand at what point would you generate the maximum alpha (if we realize any) over the benchmark. All the results are checked for outliers so that one or two stocks are not biasing the whole result.

___

 **Results** 

**Return Comparison - Companies with Insider Buying vs SPY**

|Time Period|Insider Purchase Stock Returns|S&amp;P 500 Returns|Alpha|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|1-Week|1.9%|\-0.3%|2.1%|
|1-Month|3.6%|2.0%|1.6%|
|3-Months|11.3%|6.6%|4.7%|
|6-Months|17.0%|11.9%|5.1%|
|1-Year|39.7%|22.1%|17.6%|

Surprisingly, if you had followed the insider purchases, you would have beaten SPY across all 5 different timeframes. The alpha generated would also have increased with increasing timeframe with the insider purchase trades beating the S&amp;P500 by a whopping 17.6% over the period of one year.

I have kept 1-year timeframe as my limit mainly due to two reasons. First, I started the analysis for identifying short-term plays, and secondly, given our entire dataset is over the last 4 years, anything more than 1 year would not have data for a significant chunk of our population which can affect the analysis.

___ 

**Limitations to the Analysis**

There are some limitations to the above analysis that you should be aware of before trying to replicate the trades.

* The data I collected has a lot of small-cap companies which are inherently more risky than a large-cap index like S&amp;P500. Given our returns are not risk-adjusted, the alpha we are seeing here might just be due to the higher risk you are taking on the trades \[2\]
* The analysis is limited to the last 4 years of data during which the markets were predominantly in a bull run (except the Covid-19 crash)
* Finally, this assumes that you will buy an equal amount of stock whenever a company insider does a trade which might not be practical given our inherent biases and apprehensions\[3\]

___

**Conclusion**

Usually, insider purchases are used to gauge the overall market sentiment. A very high proportion of sells over buys signify that insiders are losing confidence in the stock/industry and it’s time to get out of that market.

This analysis shows that the individual trades can be used for identifying stocks that are worth buying by analyzing the insider purchase patterns. This should be just considered as a primer into the topic as SEC Form 4 has a treasure trove of information \[4\].

You may or may not implement this strategy based on your investment style. But at the very least, you should check for the insider transaction pattern before investing in a particular security!

**Footnotes and Existing Research**

\[1\] SEC Form 4 is what an insider file when he/she makes a transaction. It’s expected to be filed within 2 days, but I observed more delay than that in many cases. For the purpose of this analysis, I have considered transactions that were reported no later than 10 days.

Jeng and Richard Zeckhauser of Harvard found that insider purchases beat the market by 11.2% per year. Even after adjusting for the risk using the CAPM model, the returns beat the market by 8.5%

**Introduction**

Two recent papers \[Johansen and Sornette, 1999a, Johansen et al., 2000\] have presented increasing evidence on the Oct. 1929, Oct. 1987, Hong-Kong Oct. 1987 crashes, on the Aug. 1998 global market events and on the 1985 Forex event on the US dollar, for the following hypothesis \[Sornette et al, 1996\] describing stock market crashes : we propose that they are caused by a slow build-up of long-range time correlations reflecting those between traders leading to a collapse of the stock market in one critical instant.

This build-up manifest itself as an over-all power law acceleration in the price decorated by “log-periodic” precursors. Here, “log-periodicity” refers to a sequence of oscillations with progressively shorter cycles of a period decaying according to a geometrical series.

In addition, extensive statistical tests have been performed \[Johansen et al., 2000, Johansen, 1997\] to show that the reported “logperiodic” structures essentially never occurred in ≈ 105 years of synthetic trading following a “classical” time-series model, the GARCH(1,1) model with student-t statistics, often used as a benchmark in academic circles as well as by practitioners. Thus, the null hypothesis that log-periodicity could result simply from random fluctuations is strongly rejected

**Conclusion**

We have presented a synthesis of the available empirical evidence in the light of recent theoretical developments for the existence of characteristic log-periodic signatures of growing bubbles in a variety of stock markets as well as currencies.

We have here documented 8 unrelated crashes from 1929 to 1998, on stock markets as diverse as the US, Hong-Kong or the Russian market and on currencies.

In addition, we have discovered a significant bubble on Wall Street ending in 1962 \[Johansen et al., 2000\] as well as “anti-bubbles”on the Nikkei since 1990 and the Gold (after the 1980 bubble maximum) \[Johansen and Sornette, 1999c\].

Quite unexpectedly, we have shown that the Russian bubble crashing 14 in Aug. 1997 had close to identical power law and log-periodic behaviour to the bubbles observed on Wall Street, the Hong-Kong stock market and on currencies.

To our knowledge, no major financial crash preceded by an extended bubble has occurred in the past 2 decades without exhibit a logperiodic signature.

In this context, note that the novel analysis of the Russian index presented here was motivated by Ilinski’s claim of a crash without log-periodic signature, which we have shown to be incorrect.

All these results, taken together with the remarkable robustness and consistency of the estimation of the exponent β as well as the more important statistics the scaling ratio λ, make the case for power law acceleration and log-periodicity very strong.

In our opinion, one can no more ignore these very specific and strong signatures which is characteristic of developing bubbles and this calls for further investigations to unravel in more depths the underlying economical, financial and behavioural mechanisms.

These different cases, together with the 1962 “slow event” as well as the “anti-bubbles”, show that the log-periodic critical theory applies both to bubbles ending in a sudden crash as well as to bubbles landing smoothly.

This is in fact a strong prediction of our rational model of imitative behaviour. What we have attempted here is not to explain why crashes happens or bubbles exists, but to quantify the process taking place during extended bubbles that very often lead to the rapid regime switching a crash represent. We have offered evidence that bubbles and anti-bubbles have log-periodic and power law characteristics and hence provides for a quantification of extended “moods” on the markets.

We have furthermore, provided a model which contains the observed signatures. Whether, as proposed, discrete scale invariance or some other mechanisms \[Sornette, 1998\] are responsible for the prominent log-periodic signatures observed, only a more detailed microscopic model can answer.",1,Predicting Financial Crashes Using Discrete Scale Invariance [Research paper]

„Nike reports earnings tonight for their first financial quarter of 2022 (covering the months June-August 2021). The consensus revenue estimate calls for 12.54bn in revenue (1.6% q-o-q increase), with the highest estimate pegged at 12.9bn in revenue (4.6% q-o-q increase). Estimates call for EPS of 1.12, which has recently been revised downward slightly as people are worried about supply chain issues in Vietnam (more on that later).

Nike's brand strength and pricing power is unparalleled among retailers, and I think they will outdo the revenue expectations and see a decent upwards bump in price. Store reopenings in Europe and coastal USA should work in their favor this quarter, while they still benefit from tremendously strong digital channels.

**Store visits**

While May and June were comparatively weak, according to this data Nike did very well in July and August to make up for it. They outperformed especially in New York and California, while being approximately on par with Lulu in Texas and Florida. According to Linkedin, they have also increased their sales personnel by 3% over the past 6 months.

**Website visits**

Nike has also seen a nice uptick in website hits in recent months. According to Similarweb, their website had a total of 361.5 million from June-August, compared to 330 million in the previous 3 months, for a 10% increase 

**Risks**

This is probably one of the riskier plays I’ve posted here since expectations for Nike are actually quite high. The main reason I’m even posting it is that they dropped quite a lot in the past weeks and it’s looking oversold, and the overall market looks strong right now. Don’t bet the house on this one.

Nike had fantastic earnings and a huge jump 3 months ago, and is now trading a couple percent above that level. It's somewhat uncommon (but not unheard of) for stocks to have 2 big jumps after consecutive earnings reports.

The Put-call open interest ratio is skewed towards put, which indicates people are generally bullish. This play more or less goes along with the consensus view, which isn’t always the right move.

Supply chain issues might be worse than I estimate. Even if they aren’t, Nike might decide to lowball guidance to play it safe. I'm not Vietnamese, don't read Vietnamese, and don't know anyone in Vietnam. I have no idea how bad the supply chain issue will be - I am simply making an educated guess based on publicly available English-language sources.“",1,NIKE - earnings report and my opinion

If you have one security that is listed and trade on different exchanges, i.e. has a London line / Australian line, or London line / ADR, etc... when fx'ing the share prices to a common currency, we'd expect them to trade in line with one another (law of one price, else arbitrage).

If the securities prices have been trading a siginificant spread over time - what would you attribute this to? Valuation of the sum of parts in the London book vs Aussie line being justified through their P/E? etc.

nafizzaki,"Lobby groups are warning that activity in the world’s biggest bond market could grind to a halt at the end of this month without last-minute exemptions to an obscure 50-year-old rule in the US that has previously taken aim only at stocks.

Bond trade associations have written to regulators to say amended rules will have a “significant, deleterious effect” on government and corporate bond markets, and pleaded for an explicit reprieve, or more time to comply. The amendments were first proposed last year, but market participants assumed until recent months that the rules would continue to pertain to the stock market alone.

“We believe that such an application of the rule is overbroad and unnecessary”, wrote the Bond Dealers of America and the Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association.

The SEC’s 1971 statute, known as ‘rule 15c2-11’, governs the “publication or submission” of prices to buy and sell securities away from exchanges. Market participants have largely considered it an attempt to guard retail investors from predatory schemes and fraudulent activity in penny stocks. 

The rule requires broker dealers such as JPMorgan Chase and Citi to check a wide range of information on issuers, including quarterly and annual reports. Last year the SEC, then led by Jay Clayton, tweaked the rules for the first time in almost three decades, and included a requirement for the information to be publicly available.

“These retail investor-focused improvements to Rule 15c2-11 are long overdue,” said Clayton at the time, adding that advances in technology meant investors could be privy to more up-to-date information before trading.

The statute has never explicitly excluded bonds but, in practice, it has never applied to them in its 50-year existence. This has long suited a market where many corporate issuers are not listed on stock markets and do not routinely produce regular earnings reports. It is unclear what disclosures would be required for government bonds, such as those issued by the US Treasury.

But Michael Decker, vice-president of policy and research at BDA, said the SEC, led by new chief Gary Gensler, has confirmed the rules will also affect government and corporate bonds under the amendments outlined last year. Only municipal securities have an explicit exemption. 

“Here we are a matter of days away and very little work has been done. It is pretty clear to me that the SEC hasn’t really thought this through,” said Decker.

The SEC declined to comment. 

Rising awareness of the new requirements has sown confusion in the bond market as bankers, trading platforms and investors now face intense compliance demands ahead of an unforeseen month-end deadline. 

The concern is that without guidance or amendment from the SEC, trading in part of the bond market will cease when the rule comes into force at the end of this month, as broker dealers back away for fear of attracting an enforcement action from securities regulators. 

The SEC’s move comes at a time of increasing regulatory scrutiny of fixed income trading, with Gensler noting this month that he intends to bring greater efficiency and transparency to the market. 

Broker dealers are scrambling to understand how to gather, review and publish information on the companies whose bonds they trade. They are also questioning what counts as publication or submission of a quote on a bond — terms left undefined in the rule.

Bond trading has increasingly transitioned to trading on electronic venues, with prices streamed on screens. In an attempt to avoid publishing quotes, some market participants could shift trading back to phones until clearer guidance is available. 

“The risk is that if the broker dealers feel they can’t be in compliance based on the interpretation of their internal teams then they might be forced to stop quoting certain bonds to ensure they aren’t out of compliance,” said Kevin McPartland, head of research, market structure and technology at Greenwich Associates.",1,US bond lobbies warn SEC of severe disruption under rule change

ILikeTalkn2Myself,"Ford Motor has tapped Redwood Materials to create a closed loop system for its upcoming deluge of electric vehicles — a partnership that will cover recycling production scrap and EVs at the end of their life as well as supplying the automaker with raw battery materials.

The deal comes as Ford adds more electric vehicles to its portfolio, including the Mustang Mach E that launched last year and the upcoming[ F-150 Lightning pickup truck](https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/16/ford-boosts-spending-to-increase-production-capacity-of-its-f-150-lightning-electric-truck/). Securing a supply of batteries — or the materials to make them — has prompted the automotive industry to partner with cell manufacturers and increasingly turn to companies like Redwood Materials.

Ford alone will require a hefty supply. The company’s global plans for battery electric vehicle calls for at least 240 gigawatt hours of battery cell capacity by 2030, according to the automaker. That is roughly 10 plants’ worth of capacity. Ford has previously said that 140 GWh will be required in North America, with the balance dedicated to other regions, including Europe and China.

“Closing the loop for us in our end-of-life products and allowing those to re-enter the supply chain will help us drive down costs,” Lisa Drake, Ford’s chief operating officer in North America, said during a press briefing. “Of course, it’ll help us reduce the reliance on importing a lot of the materials that we use today when we build the batteries. And then it’ll reduce the mining of raw materials, which is going to be incredibly important in the future as we start to scale on this space.”

All of this, Drake says, will made EVs cheaper and more sustainable.

Redwood Materials recycles scrap from battery cell production and consumer electronics like cell phone batteries, laptop computers, power tools, power banks, scooters and electric bicycles. The company, which was founded and is led by former Tesla CTO JB Straubel, says it can recover, on average, more than 95% of the elements like nickel, cobalt, lithium and copper.

Redwood then processes these discarded goods, extracting materials like cobalt, nickel and lithium that are typically mined, and supplies those back to its customers, which today includes Panasonic at the Gigafactory in Nevada that it operates with Tesla and Envision AESC’s battery plant in Tennessee. Redwood has also partnered with Amazon to recycle EV and other lithium-ion batteries and e-waste from parts of their businesses. Redwood’s first automotive partnership was secured earlier this year with electric commercial vehicle manufacturer Proterra.

“The risk is that we find ourselves in a situation perhaps a little bit similar to current global semiconductor shortage if we don’t plan ahead, and if we aren’t strategic about the production capacity and the right regions at the right time,” Straubel said during the briefing.  

Under the partnership announced Wednesday, Redwood Materials will initially work with Ford to set up recycling within the automaker’s battery production network and then funnel the recovered raw materials back to the manufacturer to be used in batteries. While Ford didn’t provide specific details, that likely means working with its battery cell supplier SK.

In May, Ford and SK signed an initial agreement to create a joint venture — to be called BlueOvalSK — to produce approximately 60 gigawatt hours annually in traction battery cells and array modules, starting mid-decade.

The ultimate aim of the Redwood Materials-Ford partnership is to touch the entire battery lifecycle from recycling production scrap and supplying Ford with materials to creating recycling options for the end-of-life vehicles. That last piece is complex because Ford will no longer own its EVs, many of which will have multiple owners before they’re ready for the scrap heap.

The deal follows a string of announcements in recent months by Redwood Materials. The company recently raised more than $775 million — a round that TechCrunch learned includes $50 million from Ford. (The company initially announced the round was [more than $700 million](https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/28/redwood-materials-raises-700m-to-expand-its-battery-recycling-operation/).)

It also revealed in September plans to [expand its business](https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/14/jb-straubels-redwood-materials-is-expanding-into-the-battery-materials-business/) beyond battery recycling and into the production of critical battery materials at a new million-square-foot factory in the United States. Redwood wants to produce cathodes and anode foils, the building blocks of a lithium-ion battery structure.

The factory, for which the company is currently scouting a location, would likely be dedicated to the production of cathodes. Redwood has said it intends for the factory to ramp up to 100 gigawatt hours of capacity to produce cathode material, enough for one million electric vehicles by 2025.

\*(Bien comprendre le WealthHUB : c'est un algorithme multi node et multi routes - cela permet d'accéder à la meilleure liquidité disponible et le meilleur prix pour éviter l'exécution de trade hors de prix et garantir la meilleure exec (prix/ temps)Exemple :

Pour vendre de l'EUR et Acheter du DOGE pour 10000 EUR - exemple avec le richHub :

1/ exécution de 2000 EUR en BUSD puis BUSD en DOGE en utilisant Binance2/ exécution de 7000 EUR en USDT puis USDT en DOGE en utilisant KRAKEN3/ exécution de 1000 EUR en ETH puis ETH en DOGE en utilisant BITTREX)

Cela permet toujours d'avoir de la liquidité et surtout de garantir le meilleur prix par rapport à la liquidité disponible sur le marché =&gt; surtout pour les ordres qui dépassent les 100K

AKT est une banque et ne remplace pas pas Binance ou un DEX, il cherche un amener de la liquidité à la défi et aux échanges crypto mais pas que, L'Europe détient la plus grande quantité d'épargne au monde et des taux proches de 0 ou négatif donc aucun rendement.

Compte courant, épargne défi, robot et accès aux marchés d'échanges sous une même application le tout connecté à une carte de paiement. L'argent n'est jamais bloqué et reste dispo instantanément.

Attention, leurs cibles ne sont pas des noob, ce sont des personnes qui cherchent à être accompagnées sans barrière technique trop compliquée à d'autres outils d'investissement tout en gardant un contrôle total sur leurs argents pour les besoins quotidiens - en connectant la carte au richesse hub cela signifie qu'un paiement peut être fait depuis le coffre-fort compte qui est connecté à AAVE (a terme d'autre solution aussi) et permet donc de générer des intérêts quotidiens et de payer avec…

Nous sommes encore au début d'un massif de phénomène donc il y a encore beaucoup d'opportunité à saisir.

Pour les fans de Hedera, ils ont un partenariat en cours. Ils font le codage de leur jeton. Hedera qui parle d'un investissement de plusieurs millions d'euros (20M) et ne prend ni actions ni tokens, c'est un simple investissement dans le but de developper et vendre leur blockchain

l'idée est surtout de développer des outils décentralisés avec Hedera, pas d'augmenter le volume de transactions spéculatives qui n'est finalement qu'une niche, ils veulent ajouter de la valeur dans les transactions et augmenter le volume (ex : décentralisé le KYC, le paiement, le track record des opérations et leur traitement comptable, l'emprunte carbone digitale par utilisateur, etc…) le DLT de Hedera est le plus régulé au monde, (une fois que les régulateurs vont secouer le cocotier on verra ceux qui restent en place)Un régulateur peut imposer un arrêt net des opérations des acteurs décentralisés et donc tué son business du jour au lendemain… ce sera pas le cas avec un partenaire comme Hedera

Token côté chez Bittrex probablement le 26 octobre - un échange Bittrex puis step by step. Les bourses n'ont presque pas de liquidités et les teneurs de marché sont obligés d'adapter leurs stratégies en fonction du volume journalier et de l'attrait sur le jeton ou la crypto. Il faut donc d'abord pouvoir absorber les échanges sur un échange et attendre que l'élan augmente avant de se projeter sur d'autres échanges. Nous réussirons les meilleur prix 'exec avec Bittrex donc l'utilisateur en vendant son Coin sur Akt sera bien exécuté au bon prix en fonction du choix de son abonnement (free, premium)

MrIndira,"A credit default swap is "" a financial contract whereby a buyer of corporate or sovereign debt in the form of bonds attempts to eliminate possible loss arising from default by the issuer of the bonds. This is achieved by the issuer of the bonds insuring the buyer’s potential losses as part of the agreement. ""   


Essentially, it is insurance for the creditor in the case of default from a debtor. 

A creditor can get into these credit default swaps contracts, where a creditor pays a fixed amount to another party (the insurer) and when/if the debtor to the creditor defaults  the insurer will step in to make the creditor whole.

Now, people have known about Evergrande and their liquidity issues for about a year. Investors (Debtors) would have purchased these credit default swap contracts for Evergrande.   


Now, apparently this week is full of holidays for China - so TOMORROW, when a good chunk of China is back to work AND when China is expected make an announcement as to whether or not they will SAVE Evergrande or let it default, THEN we  will find out how the markets truly respond to this catastrophe.  


**What would be the effect of the credit default swaps on the rest of the financial markets?** Obviously, we don't know who the insurers are, but I'd imagine that that insurer is probably issuing securities out of its pooled credit default payments. Like all insurance companies.  
FYI, Credit Default Swaps are what really hurt AIG during the 2008 housing crisis.

Side note: Everyone is expecting China to step in and save Evergrande or at least prevent contagion effects throughout the chinese markets.

Worse still, the response will be led by individuals who are only versed in the same failed ideologies that brought us to where we are now. Although questions of underlying ideology may be dismissed by “practical” individuals who pride themselves on being “independent thinkers,” Austrian economics accounts for the degree to which our intellectual environment directly guides policy and institutional frameworks. In the aftermath of the challenging times that may be ahead, the only way to build a stronger, more prosperous, and more stable future will be with an ideological revolution.

sportsdirectbandit,"Hello,

I am looking to make my first real investments in the stock market, I am doing some research into sectors that I feel might benefit in the long term.

My area of competency is technology, my theory is that most governments are moving towards Net-Zero emissions in the next few years forcing the sale of Electric Vehicles. I don’t think the price of batteries will come down all too much as historically there has been minimal improvement in the space - although I do support this innovation I think cars will be expensive for next few decades.

This leads me to believe that most consumers will finance a vehicle rather than selling it, and this seems to be a popular option even in today’s market.

I am trying to find companies that lend money primarily for the purpose of a car loan but searching through google just leads me to endless advertisements. I am really struggling to find good information about how the business model actually works.

Can anyone shed some light on this subject? Do car makers deal with the financial services themselves? Do people go to banks for this or are there a list of companies I can compare to gauge the historic performance of this model to see if it is the right investment for me?

Dominyck,"I've put together an Excel Monte Carlo simulation which shows a portfolio carrying a small amount of leverage (meaning 1.2 assets to equity) on an initial deposit with no rebalancing, would imply roughly a 1-2% risk of exceeding the Reg T margin limit over a 25 year period.

\- Potential Gamma Squeeze, SPAC merging with Moneylion

None of those arguements hold any weight at all. A dividend has a tax attached to it eating into your returns. A dividend literally eats into the value of your stock; 1% dividend is 1% decrease in stock value.

Still sitting on some more cash waiting to go in. Had a bigger ""emergency"" fund before, so missed out on all of the ride up sitting in a hysa.

But once I decided to go for it with the S&amp;P, I started DCA in and pretty much went in at all the highs.

I wasn't there for the ride up, so just being there for the ride down doesn't seem that appealing.

What do you guys think and are we heading down a bit? Since I waited so long already missing out on all the gains, might it not make sense to wait a little more and actually go in at a lower point, to not end up going in only at highs?

I'm a young guy with quite a lot of money very regularly coming in due to a Web3 project I have taking off. I live modestly and have been putting probably 80% of my income into investments. I've set a pretty comfortable risk tolerance, and my time horizon is more than 20 years.

I've found myself buying into $VOO on regular intervals lately. It feels safe, doesn't take a lot of time, etc. I've gradually been scaling into using margin, because I strongly believe that, over my time horizon, the returns I'll get from an S&amp;P index fund will beat out the 0.75% interest rate they offer me.

However, I learned about leveraged S&amp;P ETFs recently, such as $SPUU, $SSO, $UPRO. These mostly seem to have a higher expense ratio than $VOO, but my understanding is that these are able to achieve a similar leverage affect of using margin in the way I am, without using margin.

I was just wondering if I'm understanding this correctly. If I'm comfortable going in 1:1 on margin into $VOO, am I then better off just buying $SPUU and not using margin instead (assuming the expense ratios are in my favor). Are there any differences or disadvantages of these leveraged ETFs that I'm not understanding, when compared to going into $VOO on margin?",1,Leveraging into an S&amp;P index
wolley_dratsum,"I have over $1 million in my IRA,  100% invested in VTS. I won’t touch this nest egg for at least another 10-15 years and maybe longer. This is truly my buy-and-hold account.

So obviously, today’s market drop doesn’t concern me in the least.

I have another $10,000 in a taxable account that I use for fun things: beer money, casino trips, video game purchases, spa treatments, etc.

This is money I am not investing for the long term. I will spend this down between now and retiring. I am more interested in capital preservation.

For this reason I invested this money in an “all-weather” portfolio, an idea pioneered by [billionaire hedge fund manager Ray Dalio](https://www.optimizedportfolio.com/all-weather-portfolio/) and popularized in [Tony Robbins’ book “Money: Master the Game](https://fourminutebooks.com/money-master-the-game-summary/).

This portfolio is designed to make money in most any market and rarely ever lose money.

Here is how I have invested this $10,000:

* 30% Vanguard Total Stock Market ETF (VTI)
* 40% iShares 20+ Year Treasury ETF (TLT)
* 15% iShares 7 – 10 Year Treasury ETF (IEF)
* 7.5% SPDR Gold Shares ETF (GLD)
* 7.5% PowerShares DB Commodity Index Tracking Fund (DBC)

So far this portfolio has performed fine and I have been happy with the performance. 

I have not had a chance to see the all-weather portfolio put to the test…until today.

As I saw red everywhere today I opened up my Robinhood app with curiosity to check my balance.

I have no idea how my IRA did today and honestly don’t want to look but my all-weather portfolio was actually UP today by 0.02%.

I recommend this portfolio for short-term goals (savings for a house down payment, for example) or as a hedge against sequence of returns risk. If it’s money you don’t want to risk losing this might be worth checking out.",1,Had an interesting test today for my “all-weather” portfolio

# Competition

  

Innoviz, Microvision, Velodyne, Aeva, Ouster, Aeye, Luminar

  

Cepton has a huge leg up on its competitors by having the largest production award (GM) as well as partnership with a key tier 1 supplier (Koito). According to both Cepton's investor presentation and S-4 filing, these things take considerable time (2+ years) &amp; have incredible competition (at least 30 lidars considered for GM production award). No other lidar company expects deployment on a significant number of vehicle models (especially non-luxury) anytime in the near future.

  

Microvision (MVIS) has completed their **prototype** lidar in April 2021. Cepton finished their prototype in 2017, and is currently fine tuning the mass production process. Futhermore, Microvision recently claimed that they would win the markets by being cheap and selling their lidars for an AVERAGE of less than $1000. Cepton lidars are &lt; $500 with the Nova lidar being &lt; $100. Needless to say, Cepton is not concerned with competition from Microvision at the moment.

  

Another interesting fact I noticed: many Velodyne and Innoviz leaders have left and decided to join Cepton.

# Bear Cases 

  

The merger falls apart. This seems quite unlikely as both Cepton and GCAC have experienced leadership &amp; backgrounds. 

  

Cepton's deal with GM falls through. While again this is theoretically possible, the chances seem very small based on the investor presentation &amp; S-4 filing. Cepton had been in talks with GM for years before the announcement, and GM went through an extensive selection process of over 40 other lidar companies. Furthermore, Cepton is already partnered and supported by Koito, a Tier 1 supplier already approved and supplying parts for GM vehicles. 

  

The AV market is a bust. Cepton is currently focused on mass-market Lidar serving ADAS, which is a very real &amp; growing market. While it is true that currently the lidar market is pretty saturated, there is definitely an addressable market for ADAS in vehicles in the next 5 years. Cepton's ability to actually land the largest known Lidar production deal is nothing to scoff at.

# Conclusion

  

Cepton has strong fundamentals, landed impressive deals and partnerships, and is positioned to be a breakout leader in the lidar market. ADAS (safety &amp; assist) is not as sexy as AV (self driving), but there is a clear market for it TODAY, and Cepton has already taken the first step with the landmark deal to supply lidar for multiple GM cars.

  

As of writing this post, GCAC is trading at $9.89, and is a relatively low-risk investment as SPAC's typically have a $10 floor due to the ability to redeem the stock at closing of the merger for $10.

While the lidar &amp; SPAC markets are not so hot at the moment, I still see Cepton as undervalued at the moment, and the situation as a great low-downside investment opportunity. If Cepton succeeds with its engagements with all top 10 OEM's, then this current price would be one hell of a steal. 

  
  
  

**Game plan**  

I bought &amp; plan to hold shares for several years. 

You can also just play the merger - buy now, then hold until the merger date &amp; decide then whether to keep or sell.
  
- Buy shares, GCAC will change to CPTN after the merger. Shares will be 1:1
- Warrants, GCACW, if you're not familiar how warrants work they are essentially call options with a fixed strike price of $11.50
- Options trading - buying calls &amp; selling puts

  
  

**TL;DR:** 

Cepton quietly landed massive deals &amp; partnerships, and is positioned to be a breakout lidar company. Currently GCAC is trading at &lt;$10, which is usually the floor for SPACs. This seems like a fairly low-risk low-downside investment, with great upsides at the moment since awareness of Cepton is so low.

- 70% of wealth in China is held in property (elsewhere average is btw. 20 to 35%)
- Evergrande’s international payment obligations are due on Thursday
- 1/3 of current China GDP is created by construction and property related activity (builders, materials/commodities, industrials/machines, services, etc) 
- China property market (sales) has been lagging for some months already
- a lot of Chinese investors have been harmed by the regulatory actions of Chinese tech companies, hence sentiment sensibility is heightened



Outlines of 3x spill over scenarios 
----------------------------
1.) Unorderly containment + large spill over
Evergrande default spills over to other property and real estate firms in China with unorderly containment, leading to a considerable decline in many related industries (incl. services). Property prices in China would collapse and lead to a moderate sell-off -&gt; the rather significant negative GDP impact would hit Chinese wallets directly, leading to severe repercussions for China-focused firms (global) and China’s future growth in general

-&gt; large impact on international markets (most sectors), global crisis potential, quicker decline of China’s GDP, FED would have to delay tapering 


2.) Orderly containment - moderate spill over
Evergrande default spills over to other property firms in China with orderly containment, resulting in a moderate decline in a few related industries (construction, concrete/steel, machines, real-estate) -&gt; the GDP decline would impact China’s domestic spending/consumption power and lead to a medium-long term cooling of the China property market

-&gt; moderate impact on international markets (few sectors only), less long-term effects, slow-paced decline of China’s core GDP


3.) Orderly containment - small spill over
Evergrande default spills over to a few selected property firms in China (with large leverage). China’s gov steps in quickly and aggressively to ensure an orderly containment with a direct relief to calm down markets, resulting in a small decline in a few related industries (construction, concrete/steel, machines, real-estate) -&gt; the slight GDP decline would result in rather short-term consequences for China’s domestic spending/consumption power. The CCP would at least manage to keep property prices stable, the spill over effects would be barely visible.

The recent chip shortage has shown that the U.S can't keep up with semiconductor demand. Joe Biden has laid out a $50B subsidy plan for research and development in the semiconductor industry. In the CEO Summit on Semiconductor Supply Chain Resilience, Biden stated that this was a “once in a generation” investment for the future. Semiconductor chips are as essential to our everyday lives as water.

\[Source\]([https://sst.semiconductor-digest.com/2002/06/reducing-water-usage-in-semiconductor-manufacturing/](https://sst.semiconductor-digest.com/2002/06/reducing-water-usage-in-semiconductor-manufacturing/))

​​4 ways to reduce water consumption in semiconductor manufacturing:

* Transition from wet to dry etching
* Improvements on the efficiency of etching processes used for ultrapure water (UPW) production
* Optimization of tools and procedures for UPW production process
* Reuse of spent rinse waters/wastewater streams

**Technical Analysis**

📷

Looking at the 6-month chart for TSM, strong resistance and support lines indicate a resistance around the $125 mark and solid support around the $108 mark. A buying opportunity may come up if we see TSM dip down near its support range. Bullish breakthrough at $125 and bearish breakthrough at $108.

**Conclusion**

The biggest issue the semiconductor industry faces today is heating. Semiconductor fabs use the water equivalent of 12 golf courses. The solution to this problem is dry etching which uses gaseous chemicals to make patterns on substrates. Large fabricators have their own methods for reusing water but to be frank, are only scratching the surface. TSM’s Green Marketing Strategy does little to address the issue at hand. The semiconductor industry is expected to grow by 25% with water consumption expecting to increase by 15%. Aside from this issue, TSM has a comparative advantage over its rival Intel. TSM has a significantly higher market cap, lower total debt, and fewer liabilities. TSM doesn’t pay out dividends but instead uses the money to grow its business. Intel has mediocre dividends at best. TSM will be a trillion-dollar company in the next 5-10 years. Biden’s $50B subsidy plan will revamp production and should hopefully put the U.S in contention for the global semiconductor producer leader. TSMs new $100B fabs in Arizona will be a catalyst for domestic semiconductor production with growing support from U.S subsidies. TSM has a positive outlook for the next 3-4 years.

physioworld,"let's say i start a business with a friend and the cap table shows we each have 50% of the shares. We agree to a given vesting period, say 4 years with a 1 year cliff and we have leaver provisions such that when you leave the company you keep any vested shares but not unvested shares. If I or my friend leaves the business after say, 2 years and have vested half of our shares, does that mean that the co-founder who remains ends up owning 75% of the shares and the departed co-founder owns 25%?

wallstjunky,"I know many of you reading this are DIY investors, and that is absolutely great!  For some of you, it might make sense now or later down the road to consider pursuing an Investment Advisor/Financial Advisor.  I myself, work for a Boutique RIA firm as a portfolio manager, and am in no way soliciting my business, but instead, I put together a list of questions to use as a guide for the ""Interview Process"".  Before I get into it, my recommendation if you choose to hire an Advisor, make sure they are a Fee-Only Fiduciary, this is usually the most transparent type of advisor out there.  This can protect you from being sold crappy investment products that put money in your advisors pocket that likely aren't best suited for you.

1.       Tell me about your qualifications and experience? 

You NEED to know how long your advisor has been in the industry and what education and designations they have.  The CFP, CFA, and CPA are some of the most prestigious and well-recognized designations that an advisor can have.

2.       What problems can you solve and what services do you provide?

Financial advisors can perform a multitude of different functions, so finding the one that fits your needs and has the expertise you are looking for.  You want an advisor is isn’t just one-dimensional (i.e. only selling insurance products) but rather can offer many different types of advice like real estate, equities, alternatives, etc.

3.       Who else stands to gain from the services you provide me?

You want a clear understanding of any other third parties that aim to benefit off the services your potential advisor is giving you.  Advisors that sell a certain product, mutual fund, or policy typically have a pre-arranged relationship that usually comes in the form of compensation when providing these products.

4.       Have you ever been professionally disciplined?

FINRA, CFA, state agencies, and CFP boards keep records on the disciplinary history of candidates and advisors.  You should verify with these entities if your potential advisor has ever been reprimanded or professionally disciplined.

5.       How secure are your services?

Cybersecurity is a serious issue, so you want to make sure what systems your advising company has in place, how the information is store, what software partners they are working with, and ultimately how is your sensitive data being stored.  At the end of the day, the Financial Advisor is going to have a lot of your personal financial data, so you just want to make sure how secure it really is.

6.       How much control do I have over decisions made?

FAs have different scopes of ability and services.  Some have complete discretion and control over the account with no client input, while other FAs serve as more of an educator and the client does have a lot of input.  If you are looking for someone to make all the investment-management decisions for you, then find an advisor that can serve in that capacity.  If, on the other hand, you are more of a DIY type investor, find an advisor that can serve as a second set of eyes while still giving you the ability to pick what securities or investment vehicles to include in your portfolio.

7.       How are you getting paid?

For any reputable FA can answer this question.  There isn’t one right answer for the fee structure that is best for you, but you definitely want one of transparent.  There are so many types of fee structures, so try to understand how your FA actually gets paid.

8.       Ask him or her to explain a concept to you

This allows you an opportunity to see their ability to communicate effectively.  A large part of the financial planning process comes in the delivery of the plan itself.  Choosing an advisor who can not only develop a comprehensive financial plan but also deliver it in a way that is well understood.

Below are five concept-oriented questions to consider asking:

* What is passive vs. active investing?
* How do you determine how much of my money should be in stocks vs. bonds?
* What is a [laddered bond](http://www.schwab.com/public/schwab/investing/accounts_products/investment/bonds/individual_bonds/bond_ladders) portfolio?
* How do you determine how much money I can safely withdraw each year without running out?

However, I've been focusing on growth rather than dividends and am thing about shifting my strategy while I'm still somewhat young.

**There are three reasons that are preventing tech companies from growing faster:**

&amp;#x200B;

**1. Tech companies that don't have enough money.**

These are generally start-ups, or high-burn hungry tech companies. 

This manifests in two different ways:

1. Companies actively burning money, to show ""growth"" that is unsustainable.
2. Companies actively choosing to spend money, because they know it is going to pay off in the future (e.g. amazon spending billions on infrastructure). 

Avoid the former. Invest in the later.

&amp;#x200B;

**2. Tech companies that don't have enough talent.**

This manifests in two different ways.

1. High quality people don't want to work there. (avoid these companies). 
2. The company grew so fast, and hiring is still catching up (hyper growth co's). E.g. Zoom, Instacart, DoorDash, after covid. 

Avoid the former reason (not easily solved). Invest in the later (easily solved).

&amp;#x200B;

**3. Tech companies that don't have enough opportunities to spend.**

These are companies that just don't have enough opportunities to deploy $ or people. Typically companies with poor markets.

Avoid this category, *unless*, you see a market shift or external shift in the market.",1,Three types of tech companies

Swimming-Yesterday24," Every time leveraged ETFs are brought up, it seems the are trashed and crapped on. The most common argument I've seen is volatility decay (a simple analysis of returns since inception or even further back using 3\*QQQ would show this to be an insignificant concern in the long run). So why is this ETF so bad? 

&amp;#x200B;

I have held TQQQ since before the crash of 2020, and while it was a bumpy ride, I've continued making it a bigger component of my portfolio, happily enjoying the returns.  Obviously if you're planning on retiring soon, this doesn't work, but assuming you have a good long time horizon, I can't figure out why it's bad.",1,Why is the TQQQ ETF so bad?
th3cr1t1c,"There is no end to the number of blogs and Youtube videos that convince retail investors they too can be experts.  But what, really, is the value of that information?

There are three reasons earnings-based analyses are so popular in the investing world, even among some quasi-professionals, despite the fact that Discounted Cash Flow analysis is the preferred model for valuation across the entire industry^(1):

1. Earnings is the most readily available company metric on the internet.
2. Ratios are simple; analyses are complicated.
3. This information is cheap.

Beyond Time Value of Money, there's no more valuable information you're going to get from browsing the internet for free.  You can get access to certain types of research reports from Schwab and other discount brokerages, but it's not ""free"".  You've deposited money with and given order flow to these institutions, on which they in turn generate income.  But this is still relatively low value information compared to real, thorough equity research (it's often called ""Due Diligence"" here).  These reports cost money, and they're compiled by people with years of education and expertise, which in turn cost money.

So I'm sitting here next to a stack of just four books from my college years a quarter century ago:

1. Smith and Roberson's *Business Law.*
2. *Fundamentals of Financial Management* by Eugene F. Brigham.
3. *Management Accounting* by Anthony Atkinson &amp; Rajiv Banker (my professor).
4. *Security Analysis* by Dodd and Graham.

The fourth is by far the cheapest of them, because it's more widely used than in academia.  But together, these four books would today cost, in their hardcover editions, $1000... and that's just four introductory textbooks.  Nevermind the 4-5 years of school I had studying the soup-to-nuts of business management and, at the end of it, writing a thesis for a strategy formulation and implementation class that utilized all of the other learned disciplines in the development of a single, semester-long business case.

Very little of what analysts know in practice is something that can be distilled to the average investor without all of the years of underlying context.   Expecting you to digest this and beat the market would be like telling you to take a 5xxx or 7xxx level finance course and expecting you to place in the top 5% of the class, at a top 5% school.

So this is what really goes into business valuation exercises of any real worth.  Which is another way of saying: If you didn't pay for it, chances are it's not that valuable.

XChrisUnknownX,"Hi. I'm a stenographer in New York. I run a blog devoted to my industry. I'd been following the Verbit company for some time. During its series A funding, it was talking about 99% accuracy in record time with its automatic speech recognition stuff. By its series B funding it was saying it would use human transcribers, because despite everyone's belief that automatic speech recognition can do what we do, there's actually some evidence from the racial disparities in automatic speech recognition study that's not true. 

So I know your subreddit appears to be geared toward public investing, but obviously, I see this as private equity throwing big money at what is likely to turn out to be a zombie company. You can draw a comparison with VIQ Solutions, which has not been profitable for as long as I've followed it. I'm wondering if any of you have involvement with those kinds of private funds, or how one would even get word to them that all is not as it seems.

There are also social and legal reasons I care about this, but I will mostly omit that here since it's more or less irrelevant to the topic of investing beyond the obvious point that they're trying to gain ground into a field that has a lot of competitors and in all likelihood the unicorn will become a money burn like Google's Deep Mind.

One of the main reasons are that crypto lending platforms such as Nexo, Blockfi and Celsius are providing financial products that outperform legacy banking by far. They provide high-yield savings accounts and secured loans with no credit risk.

nobjos,"We have all heard it! -- “Time in the market beats timing the market”

At the same time, we are all to some extent guilty of trying to time the market. The market always seems to break some new all-time high records, so we wait for the inevitable crash/pullback to invest. It’s high time we put both strategies to test. Basically, what I wanted to analyze was

**Whether waiting for a crash to invest is a better investment strategy than staying invested?**

**Analysis**

For this, let’s take someone who started investing approximately 3 decades back (1993 to be exact). I created multiple investment scenarios as follows to understand the difference in returns if you

a. Invested at the exact right time when markets were lowest that particular year

b. Was extremely unlucky and just invested at the peak every year

c. Did not care about timing the market and invested at a random date every year

d. Just hoarded his cash and waited for a market crash to invest \[1\]  

For analysis simplicity, let’s assume that you were on a conservative side and never picked individual stocks, and always made your investments to S&amp;P500 \[2\]. For investment amount, let consider that you started with investing $10K in 1993 and for every subsequent year increased your investments by 5%. So, you made a total investment of $623K over the last 29 years.  

**Results**

**Investment Returns : S&amp;P 500 (1993-2021)**

|**Scenario**|**Return**|
|:-|:-|
|Invested only during a market crash|391.9%|
|Invested when markets were lowest every year|371.2%|
|Invested every month an equal amount|312.9%|
|Invested at a random date every year|303.2%|
|Invested when markets were highest every year|263.1%|

 

The analysis did throw up some interesting results. There’s a lot to unpack here and let’s break it down by each segment.

The most important insight is that **it’s virtually impossible to lose money over the long term in the market \[3\]**. Even if you were the unluckiest person and invested exactly at the very top each year, you will still end up having a 263% return on your invested amount.

At the opposite end of the spectrum, if you were somehow the luckiest person and invested only at the lowest point every year, you would have made a cool 100% more than someone who invested only at the top. Given both the hypothetical scenarios are extreme cases, let’s consider some more realistic scenarios.      

If you did not care about timing the market and invested a fixed amount each month/year, you would still make a shade over 300% on your investments.

Out of all the above scenarios, you would have made the most amount of money (a whopping 391% return) if you invested only during major crashes. In this type of investing, you would not invest in the stock market and keeps accumulating your cash position waiting for a crash.

While this seems like a good idea, in theory, it’s extremely difficult to execute properly in real life. The main limitations to investing during a crash strategy are

a. The current returns are calculated by investing at the very bottom of the crashes. It’s very difficult to identify the bottom of the crash while a crash is happening. You can end up investing midway through the crash and given that you are investing a significant chunk of capital you saved up, it can end up wiping out your portfolio.

b. [Identifying a crash itself is very hard](https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F06f96f61-9b99-4d4a-b6cd-88eece3ecc1d_624x241.png)

 As we can see from the above chart, the years that we consider were great for the market in hindsight still had significant drops within the same year. So even when the market is down 10%, it becomes extremely difficult to know whether it’s going into a deeper crash or whether it’s going to bounce back up.

**Conclusion**

While the analysis did prove that waiting for the crash is theoretically the best strategy returns-wise, practically it’s very difficult to execute it.

For e.g., even if you predicted the 2020 Coronavirus crash correctly, where would be your entry point? The market was down 15% by Mar 6th, another 10% by Mar 13th, and then another 10% by March 20th for a total of 35%. If you did not get in at the absolute bottom, you would have lost a considerable sum of your investment without actually getting any benefits from the previous run-up.     

It is extremely enticing to be the guy who called the crash correctly and even if you are right, only getting in at the absolute bottom would only give you the best returns. Adding to this, in the last 20 years, 70% of the best days in the market happened within 14 days of the worst ones \[4\]. If you miss just any of those days waiting for an entry point, your returns would be substantially lower than someone who just stayed invested.

If you think you are in the select few who have the skills to identify a crash and the temperament to see the crash through to invest at the very bottom, you will make an absolute killing in the market! For the rest of us, continuous investment regardless of the market trends seems to be the better choice.

**TL/DR:** AAWW is critically undervalued. COVID has all but annihilated international air travel volumes, driving up the price of air freight. Short term shipping disruptions have caused prices to soar, spilling over in to the air freight market. Analysts are expecting this disruption to resolve quickly, but are missing the shifts that airlines are making to narrow body jets and the impact on air freight. AAWW will have high earnings for years, and its current P/E of 4 is a joke. 13.6% of the float is shorted, and Atlas Air is free to reinitiate buybacks at the end of this month. AAWW's market cap could double and it still would trade at the rock bottom P/E of 8. Bullish AF.

\------

**Thesis**

Atlas Air Worldwide (AAWW) is critically undervalued at an absurdly low valuation given its great near- and long-term prospects; there several upcoming catalysts for a rapid revaluation.

**Background**

Atlas Air is an outsourced air services company that provides charter and other air services (""Airline Operations"") as well as leasing out their owned aircraft. Critically, the Airline Operations account for the vast majority of revenues (&gt;95%), and AAWW has a very, very heavy focus and exposure to air freight.

You may know that commercial flights also typically carry cargo. When COVID decimated international air travel, it left a few limited carriers to ship air freight internationally. Atlas Air filled that void and is making big money doing it.

**Short Term Prospects**

Beyond the COVID situation mentioned above, oceanliners have been backed up dramatically causing a squeeze in ocean freight prices. Normally, air freight costs very roughly 4-5x that of an oceanliner. But with surging rates from oceanliners, [air freight has now become competitive for many companies](https://www.economist.com/finance-and-economics/a-perfect-storm-for-container-shipping/21804500) and it is spilling over in to a squeeze on air freight. [Here's another article joking about car tires flying first class.](https://www.wsj.com/articles/air-cargo-boom-has-car-tires-flying-first-class-11630242001) So we know that Atlas Air is going to have a pretty stellar third quarter. One for their corporate history books, to be sure. But how do they fare long-term?

**Long Term Prospects**

As a side note, I believe this is where the shorts are getting it very, very wrong. *I think* they are confident that while AAWW will have a great quarter, the freight rates will come back down again and AAWW will operate with only 'modest' profits like it did pre-COVID. What they are missing is a huge transformation in the airline industry from wide-body to narrow-body jets. Narrow-body jets carry far less cargo. Greenlight Capital did a fantastic job laying this out in it's July 26, 2021 investor letter (page 4, ""Air Freight""):

&gt;While there has been some recovery in passenger aviation, airlines are emphasizing narrow-body planes, which carry less freight than wide-body planes. Compared to 2019, current air freight demand is about 10% higher and capacity is about 10% lower. The result is that cargo rates have exploded.  
Supply will be slow to come on-line. Some passenger planes are being converted to freighters, but conversion capacity for wide-bodies is limited and the aggregate impact of this will be modest. Meanwhile, air freight companies trade at tiny multiples of what investors assume to be peak profits. The implied cost of equity is quite high, which makes it difficult to justify adding assets. As a result, air freight companies are in no rush to order new planes, and in any case, new orders would take several years to build. The result is rates and profits are likely to be higher than expected for quite some time.

(Sorry, I tried to link the letter but the spam bot didn't like the URL.)

**Short Interest**

For some reason I will never understand, at a P/E of 4 with incredible foreseeable cashflows, some people have decided to short 13.6% of the outstanding shares. To be clear, this is not GameStop. But it is a high short interest in a stock with earnings prospects surging by the day as freight rates increase. It certainly doesn't hurt. But the story gets even better...

**Upcoming Catalysts**

Okay, so perhaps you believe me that AAWW is critically undervalued, that they're going to make some amazing Q3/Q4 profits, and that their long term prospects are pretty fantastic too. What will drive this rapid revaluation in the coming months? The answer was subtly slipped in to the last earnings call (google ""AAWW Transcripts Q2 2021 Earnings Call""). Spencer Schwartz, the EVP and CFO answered a question and stated:

&gt;As far as the CARES Act restrictions, so the restrictions with regard to not being able to pay dividends or repurchasing shares, those expire at the end of September.

I simply cannot imagine that in this time of record earnings, AAWW will not return that value to shareholders. If they were to announce a share buyback once the CARES Act restrictions lap, we could see AAWW finally get to a reasonable share price. I truly believe this could double in the short-term.",1,DD: Atlas Air (AAWW) is laughably undervalued and has near term catalysts for a rapid revaluation

(Bloomberg) -- The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission awarded $110 million to a tipster whose information resulted in enforcement actions, bringing total payments under the agency’s whistle-blower program to more than $1 billion.

The tipster’s award, the second-largest ever, includes $40 million from the SEC and $70 million from a related action brought by another agency, according to a statement Wednesday. Under the SEC’s whistle-blower program, tipsters can be paid for information that prompts sanctions by another agency. 

“Today’s announcement underscores the important role that whistle-blowers play in helping the SEC detect, investigate and prosecute potential violations of the securities laws,” SEC Chair Gary Gensler said in the statement. “The assistance that whistle-blowers provide is crucial to the SEC’s ability to enforce the rules of the road for our capital markets.”

The SEC has made disbursements to 207 tipsters since issuing its first award in 2012. Individuals are eligible for payments ranging from 10% to 30% of the fines collected in enforcement cases where penalties exceed $1 million. Funds used to pay tipsters don’t come out of disgorgement, the portion of a sanction that’s supposed to be returned to harmed investors.

Neither the whistle-blowers nor the firms accused of misconduct were identified by the SEC, in keeping with the federal government’s policy of withholding information that could reveal a tipster’s identity.",1,SEC Gives Whistle-Blower $110 Million in Payout

AristotleKarataev,"We see a lot of hype around popular industries like genomics, semiconductors, or cars, and often these hyped-up stocks end up becoming scarily overvalued. 

Another way to invest in growing and hyped-up industries is to invest into companies that produce the supplies for these industries, rather than the big-names at the face of it. Not to mention, you're more likely to win if you invest in a supplier versus a small cap company looking to get in on the next big thing. In some industries, like electric cars, the hype has already consumed supply such as lithium battery stocks.

This discussion is primarily inspired by /u/Thereian's comment describing these kind of stock picks:

&gt;ENTG - Semiconduct manufacturing supplier. They supply all major players. Lots of battles going on in this industry but no matter who wins (Taiwan Semi, Intel, etc) they get paid. And all of the investment that Intel and Taiwan Semi are making to build billions of dollars worth of FABs? Yeah, Entegris will get their chunk of that money. They sell the equipment upfront and the consumables going forward. Truly a fantastic company, I've owned since 2009 and am still completely bullish.

&gt;TMO - Similar to the above philosophy. Lots of expensive cell and gene therapy companies out there, those are high risk. But there's a low-risk high-reward play: Thermo Fisher. Just like ENTG in the example above, Thermo is a supplier to the whole industry.

So, this is specifically for real estate. Generally, if you own your (residential, at least) property, you can get an equity based loan at the going rate to get some cash. I know Ukraine rates are higher than the US, but are they that much higher? Pretty sure you can do a home equity loan for like 6%, and I have to assume larger commercial loans are even lower. Plus they could do a full refinance for even lower rates in the 2-3% range. I don't see how tokenizing and effectively selling 40% of your building and forfeiting a percentage of future profits is a better deal than getting a loan from a bank for 40% of the building's value at a 2-6% interest rate... and getting to keep all the profits on top of that. Unless Ukraine interest rates are like 15-20% or something, seems like the bank is a better option. I'm probably just missing something, but my question is what is the draw to bring future properties in? Why would they choose this route over traditional finance?



I definitely get the SME side, but still trying to wrap my head around the benefits for real estate owners. Are they selling portions of the property they still owe money on? That seems quite risky. Maybe I am just not savvy enough on the costs associated with taking cash out of commercial properties. I'm quite excited about this project regardless for the SME side but any clarification on the real estate side would be appreciated.",1,Theoretical question about the benefits of using Smartlands vs. traditional refinancing.

I was looking at old cryptography articles when I stumbled across this from 2008:

https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007%2F978-3-540-85230-8\_24.pdf

What struck me as interesting is that the author cited and thanked Nick Szabo (creator of bitgold - precursor to bitcoin) for discussions on OpenPGP-based financial instruments.

Furthermore, in the footnotes, the author writes: ""A server program processing various financial instruments is described in detail in xxxx's thesis \[13\]. This piece of software will be the basis for the reference implementation of the protocols and data formats used for procedures described above.""

Ref: Schuller, J.: Designing and Implementing a System for Digital Cash, Master’s Thesis, University of Bremen (2007) .

Although I cannot find the Master's thesis online.

I then did a search and found another paper written by the author from 2005:

https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007%2F978-3-540-75993-5\_3.pdf

The author identifies several key features for creating an optimal digital currency, namely, stressing digital currency should be anonymous, peer-to-peer, irreversible, etc.

I also found a link to a free/open-source, peer-to-peer digital cash/transaction software that the author created (lead founder) from 2002-2005/6 called ePoint (‘epointsystem.org’- the logo even looks kind of like Bitcoin), which abruptly stops development around 2006/2007,

In brief, the author:

-Was a highly trained cryptographer and coder (see Sourceforge link)

-Actively was developing a digital currency from 2002-2005/6, at which point the project stopped

-Had published an article in 2008 advocating for OpenPGP-based Instruments, and claims to be developing new digital cash technology based on OpenPGP principles in article

-Collaborated with Nick Szabo (created bit-gold) and references his work in publication and lecture notes

p_giggles,"Companies which operate in duopolies often have wide moats which deliver good financial performance because they're less susceptible to new entrants, often due to high barriers to entry. Many industries also mature to the point where it's only profitable for a handful of companies to operate, which can be profitable for those which survive. For an example, look at the memory semiconductor manufacturing industry. Lots of consolidation over the past two years like Intel selling its NAND business to SK Hynix and Western Digital buying Kioxia. 

My question is, what are some duopolies in relatively attractive industries? Regardless of market cap. I'll start: 

$V and $MA: one of the first duopolies many people think of, the two companies with a solid grip on the payment processing space. Have been some worries about new technology/entrants as of late but the chart for these companies tells the story. 

$WM and $RSG: waste management is a highly fragmented industry but these two companies have come out on top after Republic Services (the 3rd largest at the time) bought Allied Waste (2nd largest) in 2008. Many think of garbage disposal as a boring, defensive industry akin to utilities, but both stocks are up 150% in five years (good but not great) with a 1.5% dividend, good management and should (theoretically) offer decent downside protection in an economic downturn. 

Semiconductor capital equipment: not listing individual stocks because the entire industry is a series of duopolies between $ASM, $LRCX, $AMAT, $TOELY, and $KLAC. The technology is so damn hard and expensive to develop that the market has been whittled down to these five companies supplying most equipment for fabricating semiconductors, charts speak for themselves.

A quick Google shows UBS, Merrill Lynch, eTrade, and Morgan Stanley all offer some way for you to borrow at least 50% of the value of your equities for around 2% or less.

I'm guessing the flow is:

1. Have $1m-$10m in equities

2. Take an SBLOC of 50% of the value at 2%

3. Live your life (spend $400k-$1m/yr doing whatever it is rich people do)

4. Pay the interest back every year, keep receiving dividends, never sell any of your equities until it is time to have repaid the loan / you ran out of cash (say every 5 years), and since then your stocks have grown so you never really have less than the original number you started with equity wise

Amid the deluge of headlines in the past few days about congressional proposals to boost taxes on companies and the wealthy is one that would affect regular investors -- and potentially alter the entire U.S. fund landscape.

Draft legislation released by Senate Finance Committee Chairman Ron Wyden of Oregon on Friday **featured a repeal of a key tax advantage for the $6.8 trillion U.S. exchange-traded fund industry.** The move was tucked in along with a series of proposals to tighten tax reporting requirements around business partnerships, and wasn’t highlighted in Wyden’s accompanying press release.

The initiative would at a stroke **end a system of deferred taxes on capital gains linked to ETFs, bringing forward the tax burden for investors of all stripes.** That will make it all the tougher to win inclusion in the final version of tax hikes that Democrats are now assembling to help pay for a social-spending package that’s been penciled in at $3.5 trillion.

“The industry will push back hard” at the proposal, said Ben Johnson, director of global ETF research at Morningstar. “It’s hard for me to see this getting popular support -- in large part because it’s a benefit that is universal, so all investors, large, small and in-between, that are investing taxable money benefit from ETFs’ tax efficiency.”

The measure would bring in $205 billion over a decade, according to preliminary figures from the Joint Committee on Taxation. It would take effect in tax years beginning after Dec. 31, 2022. Wyden said in a statement Tuesday that, “This proposal exempts retirement accounts entirely.”

Wyden’s proposal was made before his committee delivers its draft of tax measures for inclusion in the budget-reconciliation bill that will form the bulk of President Joe Biden’s economic agenda.

The effort would address an advantage for ETFs that stems from a law dating back to the Nixon administration. The law exempts so-called regulated investment companies, or RICs, from recognizing a taxable gain on assets if shareholders are paid out “in kind.” In other words, if withdrawing investors are paid in securities like stocks rather than in cash.

**ETFs are structured so that money flows in and out via facilitators known as authorized participants, and redemptions for a fund almost always take place in-kind. That means that if there are enough withdrawals, an ETF can avoid recognizing taxable gains entirely. Rather than paying a tax on a fund’s gains each year, investors usually don’t pay anything until they sell their ETF.**

“Because ETFs are pass-through vehicles, by definition every cent of the increased tax flows through directly to the shareholders -- not all of whom are filthy rich,” Jeremy I. Senderowicz at law firm Vedder Price said by email.

Some ETF managers use so-called heartbeat trades to increase the amount of withdrawals and erase all of a fund’s taxable gains. A friendly bank moves a pile of cash into a fund before almost immediately pulling it out, allowing the ETF to shed stocks that have gone up in value without incurring a taxable gain.

“This particular proposal simply applies the same rules already in place for corporations to regulated investment companies, so wealthy investors can no longer avoid all tax on their gains,” Wyden said in his statement Tuesday. “We’re only talking about the taxable accounts of the wealthiest investors.”

A summary of Wyden’s proposal mentions heartbeat transactions in particular, although he proposes to erase the entire provision that allows RICs to avoid recognizing gains. The proposal “would repeal the exception for RICs, aligning RICs with the general requirement that gain be recognized upon distribution by a corporation of built-in gain property,” the summary said.

That’s a potential industry game-changer. While ETFs tend to have several advantages over mutual funds -- like the ability to trade all day and generally lower fees -- research has shown the tax loophole is a key driver in the long-term trend of cash flowing from mutual funds into ETFs. As that has gathered pace, U.S. issuers are this year for the first time directly converting mutual fund assets into ETFs.

The final package of tax hikes, including ones on corporations and wealthy individuals, may takes weeks to develop.

“Wyden right now is coming up with his own provisions that could fit into that” final legislation, said Nathan Dean, a government analyst at Bloomberg Intelligence. “Think of this as something to have in his hip pocket when the Democrats start negotiating.”

The odds may be against the ETF-related legislation ever passing, Dean said. First, because so much negotiation is still ahead, and second because it would directly impact ETFs, which are very popular with consumers. However, with so much currently up for discussion, it could slip through as a smaller provision not well-understood by lawmakers, he said. 

Senderowicz thinks the legislation has a low chance of succeeding because of the potential damage to many small investors -- but he also doesn’t rule it out.

“It’s impossible to disguise the incidence of the tax increase and thus lends itself well to political attacks,” said Senderowicz. “But if it’s a choice between it and the entire reconciliation bill coming apart?”",1,New congressional draft legislation seeks to end tax efficiency of all ETFs

HONG KONG (Reuters) -Rating agency Fitch said that numerous sectors could be exposed to heightened credit risk if China’s No.2 property developer Evergrande Group were to default, although the overall impact on the banking sector would be manageable.

Evergrande is scrambling to raise funds to pay its many lenders and suppliers, as it teeters between a messy meltdown with far-reaching impacts, a managed collapse or the less likely prospect of a bailout by Beijing.

Regulators have warned of broader risks to the country’s financial system if the company’s $305 billion of liabilities aren’t contained.

""We believe a default would reinforce credit polarisation among homebuilders and could result in headwinds for some smaller banks,"" Fitch said in a note bit.ly/3CbhKPt late on Tuesday.

&gt;Fitch downgraded China Evergrande Group to ""CC"" from ""CCC+"" on Sep. 7, indicating that it viewed a default of some kind as probable.

&gt;On Tuesday, Evergrande said it has engaged advisers to examine its financial options and warned of cross-default risks amid plunging property sales and lack of progress in asset disposals. read more

&gt;Fitch said 572 billion yuan ($88.8 billion) of Evergrande's borrowings were held by banks and other financial institutions, but banks may also have indirect exposure to the developer's suppliers, who are owed 667 billion yuan for goods and services.

&gt;""Smaller banks with higher exposure to Evergrande or to other vulnerable developers could face significant increases in non-performing loans (NPLs), depending on how any credit event involving Evergrande develops,"" Fitch said.

&gt;But the agency added a recent People’s Bank of China sensitivity test showed the average capital adequacy ratio of the 4,000 banks in the country would only drop modestly if the NPL ratio for property-development loans were to rise by 15 basis points.

&gt;Evergrande's Hong Kong-listed stock slipped as much as another 5% to HK$2.82 on Wednesday morning, a fresh low since Jan 2014.

&gt;Fitch also said the risk of significant pressure on house prices in the event of a default would be low, and it expected the government would act to protect households’ interests to ensure home deliveries.

&gt;On Wednesday, roughly 40 protesters stood near the entrance at Evergrande headquarters in Shenzhen, prevented from going inside by dozens of security personnel.

&gt;This followed chaotic scenes at the headquarters two days earlier, as disgruntled investors crowded its lobby to demand repayment of loans and financial products.

Robo advisors that are good with fixed income.

High yield corporate bond ETFs.

Tax Lien Certificate. 

&amp;#x200B;

The gist is I want higher yield than saving and money markets, but super low risk so I don't lose a chunk of my savings if there's any shock to the market or interest rate hike. 

&amp;#x200B;

Any advice is welcome. Thank you!",1,"Looking for low risk, highly liquid, short term investment."
methy_butthole,"Hello, I am very new to the world of being a responsible adult. I am saving up to buy a house, and right now I have $10k just sitting in my bank doing nothing. I invested $1250 in the stock market not really knowing what I’m doing and currently down about $300. Also invested $2k in crypto which is about even. 

I’m feeling pretty bad about losing $300 not because it’s much money but it makes me that much further from buying a house. What can I do with the $10k so that it is being productive over the next year or two saving,but with a guarantee I won’t lose anything, even if the return isn’t amazing? Thanks in advance!",1,I have $10k just sitting there what should I do with it?
ORCoast19,"I’ve been buying OXY/WS this month, kicking myself for not buying them a year ago when I first learned of them. OXY/WS is the cheapest way to invest in OXY if you believe the share price will go up significantly. They essentially give you the right to buy shares at $22 plus the current warrant price. You have up until Aug 3 2027 to exercise this right. These warrants were issued to OXY shareholders during hard times in 2020, to throw them a bone, but I imagine most bailed as the stock collapsed. 

Four reasons I like this play are…

1. Rising Free Cash Flow. Occidential petroleum has been benefiting from an increasing WTI crude oil price, hovering around $70/barrel as of today. Last quarter it averaged around $65/barrel, and they had cash flow in that quarter above 2 billion (market cap is currently ~24.4 billion for reference). Cash flow should continue to increase as crude price increases, and they work to pay down their crippling debt.

2. The Crippling Debt is Going Away. No one likes debt, right? Especially crippling debt that might bankrupt you in a sudden, extreme downturn? *cough* Covid 2020 *cough*. Apparently management got the message that their debt load could kill them, and have a plan to reduce debt by over 40%, planning to drop from 34 billion in debt at the end of 2020 to 20 billion in debt at the end of 2022. As debt gets paid down the current interest payments of 300+ million/quarter will reduce to under 200 million/quarter, adding over half a billion extra to their free cash flow!

3. Inflation Hedge. OXY has a lot of hard assets, and if US inflation takes off their stock should rise. An example of these hard assets can be found in their land holdings- they own over 1.35 million acres in the permian basin alone. If inflation is high over the next 6 years, I feel the time value of OXY/WS is being very underappreciated. As of today that time value is under $6 per warrant. 

4. Future Energy Needs. Going back to the permian basin, the land that oxy has might one day be reused for alternative energy. Believe it or not, massive solar projects can hit a wall due to environmental groups. Below’s a link of this issue recently cropping up in San Diego. For some reason, I don’t think Texas will give a damn about environmental issues, making that previously mentioned 1.35 million acres in the permian basin prime real estate for massive solar projects. In addition to solar potential, OXY has also been working on CO2 sequestering using their pre-existing oil drilling footprint.

 TERMINATION OF AMERICAN DEPOSITARY SHARES PROGRAM

This announcement is made by China Telecom Corporation Limited (the “Company”) on a voluntary basis.

We refer to the announcement of the Company dated 7 May 2021 in relation to the review decision by The New York Stock Exchange LLC (the “NYSE”) that the NYSE determined to delist the American Depositary Shares of the Company (the “ADSs”).

The delisting of the Company’s ADSs has taken effect on 18 May 2021. In light of the delisting, the board of directors (the “Board”) of the Company resolved to terminate the ADSs program (the “ADS Program”) on 9 September 2021. On the same day, the Company entered into a letter agreement with The Bank of New York Mellon, as the depositary for the Company’s ADSs, for the termination of the ADS Program.

As of 9 September 2021, the number of ADSs in issue was approximately 0.813 million and the number of H shares underlying the ADSs represented approximately 0.09% of the Company’s total issued shares. The Bank of New York Mellon has given a notice to all holders of ADSs that the ADS Program will terminate on 8 December 2021 (U.S. Eastern time) (the “Termination Date”). Holders of ADSs will have the right, at least until the Termination Date, to return the ADSs to The Bank of New York Mellon in exchange for H shares of the Company with each ADS returned to be exchanged into 100 H shares of the Company in accordance with the terms and conditions of the deposit agreement. The Company’s H shares are traded on The Stock Exchange of Hong Kong Limited. The Bank of New York Mellon expects to commence the sale of H shares of the Company represented by the remaining ADSs as soon as practicable after the Termination Date, and will pay the net cash proceeds, after deducting applicable fees and expenses, to the holders of such remaining ADSs.",1,"Advice on a Delisted stoock and recent ""Termination of Shares"" notice - what to do?"

When it comes down to sizing the global online gambling market, “all bets are on.” Grand View Research says it will grow 11.5% to $127.3 billion in 2020-2027, while The Business Research Company predicts an increase of 10.4% to $92.8 million in 2019-2023. With these estimates, gambling stocks –including those of online casinos– are roaring up.

Online Gambling Growth

It was a tough last couple of years for brick-and-mortar casinos. The American Gaming Association reports that all commercial and tribal casino properties in the U.S. closed during Covid lockdowns, with tiers 1 and 6 operating between 24% and 50% capacity upon returning to operations. 

However, with this reactivation and the technological advances of online betting, the gambling industry is back with a bang and has become one of the fastest-growing businesses on the planet.

According to Insider Monkey, the online gambling market has reached 1.6 billion people, reigniting an industry that has seen a dramatic transformation through new technology. 

Play Today says that at least 80% of Americans gambled in the past year, as users rushed to online casino directories like Canada Casinos to crash the website, looking for some blazing betting fun.

During the pandemic, the business not only grew in size but also witnessed some eye-catching movements in online gambling stocks, with companies like DraftKings Inc (NASDAQ:DKNG) soaring after its 2020 IPO.

Also, “MGM Resorts International (NYSE:MGM) launched its mobile betting app BetMGM in partnership with Roar Digital, LLC,” Insider Monkey Reports.

Stocks On The Rise

This year, 12 states in the U.S. will legalize sports betting spreading the impact to online gambling platforms. With this outlook, the famous site Gambling.com going public under the “GAMB” ticker, with a price per share estimate of 8$ –although down from $11 to $13.

The company controls more than 30 websites in 13 countries, and hit nearly $28 million in revenue in 2020 and $11.5 million in the first quarter this year.

Another attractive stock option within the online gambling market is Penn National Gaming Inc (NASDAQ: PENN), which was mentioned in the second quarter investor letter of Baron Funds.

The letter said: “Following a 232% gain in 2020, the shares of Penn National Gaming, Inc. declined 29% in the most recent quarter and are down 13% year-to-date. At its recent price of only $73 (down from a peak price of $136 in March), we believe Penn’s shares are now attractively valued.”

The casino firm is based in Pennsylvania boasting an $11.1 billion market capitalization. “PENN delivered a -17.98% return since the beginning of the year, while its 12-month returns are up by 32.73%. The stock closed at $70.84 per share on August 13, 2021.”

Brick-And-Mortar

Amid the economic comeback, brick-and-mortar casinos are also on the way up. According to Truist analyst Barry Jonas gave Las Vegas Sands Corp. (NYSE:LVS) a Hold rating “and increased its price target from $43 to $38.”

The vaccine rollout is likely to exert a positive effect on these stocks, coupled with the company’s solid earnings and optimistic forecast.

Insider Monkey reports that “In the first quarter of 2021, Las Vegas Sands Corp. (NYSE:LVS) had an EPS of $0.68, short on estimates of $0.85. The company’s net revenue decreased 15.6% or $1.20 billion from the previous quarter.”

As for Caesars Entertainment Inc (NASDAQ:CZR), the casino leader saw a solid EPS of $2.03 in the first quarter, up from $1.80. Its revenue during the same period hit $1.7 billion, an increase of 259.2% versus the last year. “Caesars Entertainment, Inc. (NASDAQ:CZR) has gained 131% in the past 12 months and 27% year to date.”

**HighGold Mining Inc. (TSX-V:HIGH, OTCQX:HGGOF)** (“**HighGold**” or the “**Compan**y”) is pleased to announce assay results for the first drill hole of the 2021 Field Season from expansion drilling at its flagship 0.75 million ounce 10.9 g/t gold equivalent (“AuEq”) Johnson Tract polymetallic Gold Project (“Johnson Tract”, “JT” or the “Project”) in Southcentral Alaska, USA.

This press release features multimedia. View the full release here: [https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210914005396/en/](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210914005396/en/)

 

Drillhole JT21-123 was designed to test along strike and down-plunge from the **JT Deposit** as a nominal 100-meter step-out from last years expansion drilling on the northeast side of the deposit (**Figure 1**). High-grade mineralization was successfully intersected in hole JT21-123, building on the success of the 2020 drill program and extending the total strike length to 600 meters.

**Drill Highlights – JT Deposit Expansion (JT21-123)**

* **13.1 g/t Au, 200 g/t Ag, 4.92% Zn, 2.04% Pb, and 0.35% Cu (20 g/t AuEq) over 4.3m including**
   * **19.0 g/t Au, 242 g/t Ag, 7.10% Zn, 2.91% Pb, and 0.50% Cu (28 g/t AuEq) over 2.8m**

“This is a great start to the 2021 drill program,” commented President and CEO Darwin Green. “Our first drill hole of the season has intersected strong precious and base metal mineralization in a large step-out from last years drilling, expanding the total strike length of JT Deposit mineralization by 15-20% to 600 meters. In addition to the excellent gold grades, the intersection includes some of the highest silver grades documented to date at the JT Deposit and is developed within a mudstone host – features often found in gold-rich VMS deposits. We are already designing follow-up holes and are excited to see how this new variation in the mineralization style at the JT Deposit develops as we continue to test at depth and along strike.” 

**Discussion of Current JT Deposit Expansion Results**

Assay results reported today include an intersection from expansion drilling at the JT Deposit from hole JT21-123 – the first drill hole completed from the 20,000-meter Johnson Tract drill program. The mineralization encountered in hole JT21-123 is hosted within a fine-grained mudstone unit (379.7 to 384.0 meters) and is similar to the ‘**VMS style**’ mineralization reported last season in hole JT20-114 (**7.8 meters at 9.8% ZnEq**) located 600 meters northeast of the JT Deposit (*See Company press release dated April 3, 2021*). The mineralization in hole JT21-123 is characterized by fine-grained disseminated sphalerite-galena-chalcopyrite-pyrite within a mudstone stratigraphically overlying strong anyhydrite-altered dacite lapilli tuff, which is characteristic of the main JT Deposit. This development continues to highlight the overall exploration potential for the Project.

Location of the step-out hole in relation to the JT Deposit is presented on a longitudinal section in **Figure 1**. The Au-Cu-Zn-Ag-Pb mineralization associated with the JT Deposit has now been defined over a total strike length of 600 meters and remains open along strike to the northeast and southwest, and at depth.

AuEq is calculated using nominal current spot metal prices of $1780/oz gold, $24/oz silver, $4.25/lb copper, $1.35/lb zinc, $1.05/lb lead and assumed recovery of 90% for all metals. True thickness for the intersection in hole JT21-123 is not well established, with a best estimate of 70% to 80% of drilled width.

**Current Initiatives and 2021 Program Update**

Three diamond drill rigs are currently operating on the Project in conjunction with a regional geological mapping and geochemical sampling program, ground-based induced polarization (“DCIP”) geophysical surveying, and a Phase I metallurgical sampling program. Assays results will be released on an ongoing basis pending review and meeting Company quality assurance-quality control protocols. An updated mineral resource estimate is planned for the JT Deposit in early 2022, following the completion and receipt of all assays from the 2021 drill program. The new resource estimate will incorporate new drilling completed in 2020 and 2021.

Over 10,000 meters of a planned 20,000 meters have been drilled to date. This includes 11 holes at JT Deposit area targets, and 15 holes at DC Prospect targets, one of several regional prospects that define a 12-km long mineralized trend at Johnson Tract. The JT Deposit expansion program includes 100-meter nominal step-outs from the known extent of mineralization along strike to the northeast and southwest, down plunge, and within the recently defined Footwall Copper Zone. For additional detail on 2021 drill targets please see Company press release dated June 23, 2021. DCIP geophysical surveying, designed to detect sulphide mineralization, is ongoing and has to date completed approximately 28-line kilometers of a planned 40-line km survey. Drilling at Johnson Tract is scheduled to continue through the end of October. Ability to complete the full 20,000 meters this season is contingent on weather and drilling conditions. Upon completion of the Johnson Tract program, drilling is expected to commence at HighGold’s Ontario gold projects.

**About the Johnson Tract Gold Project**

Johnson Tract is a poly-metallic (gold, copper, zinc, silver, lead) project located near tidewater, 125 miles (200 kilometers) southwest of Anchorage, Alaska, USA. The 21,000-acre district scale property includes the high-grade Johnson Tract Deposit (“JT Deposit”) and at least nine (9) other mineral prospects over a 12-kilometer strike length. HighGold acquired the Project through a lease agreement with Cook Inlet Region, Inc. (“CIRI”), one of 12 land-based Alaska Native regional corporations created by the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act of 1971. CIRI is owned by more than 9,100 shareholders who are primarily of Alaska Native descent.

Mineralization at Johnson Tract occurs in Jurassic-age intermediate volcaniclastic rocks and is characterized as epithermal-type with submarine volcanogenic attributes. The JT Deposit is a thick, steeply dipping silicified body (20m to 50m average true thickness) that contains a stockwork of quartz-sulphide veinlets and brecciation, cutting through and surrounded by a widespread zone of anhydrite alteration. The Footwall Copper Zone is located structurally and stratigraphically below JT Deposit and is characterized by copper-silver rich mineralization. The Au-Cu-Zn-Ag-Pb mineralization associated with the JT Deposit has now been defined over a total strike length of 600 meters and to a depth of 350 meters and remains open along strike to the northeast and southwest, and at depth.

The JT Deposit hosts an Indicated Resource of 2.14 Mt grading 10.93 g/t gold equivalent (“AuEq”) comprised of 6.07 g/t Au, 5.8 g/t Ag, 0.57% Cu, 0.80% Pb and 5.85% Zn. The Inferred Resource of 0.58 Mt grading 7.16 g/t AuEq is comprised of 2.05 g/t Au, 8.7 g/t Ag, 0.54% Cu, 0.33% Pb, and 6.67% Zn. For additional details see NI 43-101 Technical Report titled “*Updated Technical Report for the Johnson Tract Project, Alaska*” is dated August 9, authored by Ray C. Brown, CPG, and James N. Gray, P.Geo. Gold Equivalent is based on assumed metal prices and 90% recovery for Au, Ag, Cu, Pb, and Zn. Assumed metal prices for the Resource are US$1350/oz for gold (Au), US$16/oz for silver (Ag), US$2.80/lb for copper (Cu), US$1.00/lb for lead (Pb), and US$1.20/lb for zinc (Zn) and are based on nominal 3-year trailing averages as of April 1, 2020. Historical metallurgical testing on drill core samples has indicated that good gold and base metal recoveries and marketable concentrates can be expected.

Prior to HighGold, the Project was last explored in the mid-1990s by a mid-tier mining company that evaluated direct shipping material from Johnson to the Premier Mill near Stewart, British Columbia.

**About HighGold**

**Additional notes:**

The starting azimuth and dip (Azimuth/-Dip) for drillhole JT21-123 is 130/-62. Samples of drill core were cut by a diamond blade rock saw, with half of the cut core placed in individual sealed polyurethane bags and half placed back in the original core box for permanent storage. Sample lengths typically vary from a minimum 0.5 meter interval to a maximum 2.0 meter interval, with an average 1.0 to 1.5 meter sample length. Drill core samples are shipped by air and transport truck in sealed woven plastic bags to ALS Minerals sample preparation facility in Reno, Nevada for sample preparation and analysis. ALS Minerals operate according to the guidelines set out in ISO/IEC Guide 25. Gold is determined by fire-assay fusion of a 50 g sub-sample with atomic absorption spectroscopy (AAS). Samples that return values &gt;10 ppm gold from fire assay and AAS are determined by using fire assay and a gravimetric finish. Various metals including silver, gold, copper, lead and zinc are analyzed by inductively-coupled plasma (ICP) atomic emission spectroscopy, following multi-acid digestion. The elements copper, lead and zinc are determined by ore grade assay for samples that return values &gt;10,000 ppm by ICP analysis. Silver is determined by ore grade assay for samples that return &gt;100 ppm.

The Company has a robust QAQC program that includes the insertion of blanks, standards and duplicates.

For some, 2020 was the worst year to be a casino investor. For others, it was the best year in a decade. The explanation is rather straightforward. Brick and Mortar casinos suffered heavy financial losses due to the coronavirus pandemic.

If you owned stocks for Wynn Resorts, the Bellagio, and Las Vegas Sands, you had to cut your losses or hold onto your stocks despite their declining values. On the flip side, online casino shareholders recorded increased profits because the industry was not impacted by COVID.

## Buying Casino Stocks in 2021

While 2020 had mixed results for casino investors, 2021 is proving to be a better year for both types of investors. The fact that Macau casinos lost 79% of their stock values last year means they hold immense growth potential this year.

In the US, Las Vegas and Atlantic City casinos performed better than their Macau counterparts. No, they didn’t make higher profits compared to 2021. In fact, they suffered losses for half of 2021.

During the six months US casinos were up and running, though, they generated enough revenues to stay afloat. In 2021, these businesses have been in a recovery mode. Once in a while, they’re ordered to shut down or reduce capacity.

But generally speaking, most of these businesses have been open throughout 2021.Mobile gambling businesses, on the other hand, picked from where they left last year. From leading American brands like Penn National Gaming and DraftKings to 888 Sports and Paddy Power—online casino stocks are on an upward curve.

In fact, some land-based casinos—Las Vegas Sands and MGM Resorts—have already expressed their interest in buying online gambling stocks. Which stocks will they buy? No one knows.

## 5 Best Casino Stocks to Check out

Investors with high-risk appetites began bulking up gambling stocks last year. But if you’re yet to make a purchase, below is a list of five stocks to check out:

### 1. Flutter Entertainment (OTC: PDYPF)

At a price tag of $200 per share, Flutter Entertainment is a fairly expensive stock. However, it also holds incredible growth potential. Here’s why. This Irish company owns some of the biggest online gambling companies in the world:

* FanDuel
* Paddy Power
* Bet Fair
* PokerStars (The Stars Group)

FanDuel, which added 900,000 new players last year, generated 91% of the company’s US revenue in 2020. FanDuel dominates 36% of the American sports betting industry, estimated to be worth over $5 billion.

Much of Flutter’s growth potential comes from the US. And that’s not just because of FanDuel. Online gambling is increasingly becoming legal in the US. This will lead to more sales and a growing stock value for OTC: PDYPF.

DraftKings’ is FanDuel’s biggest competitor in the US. As such, the growth of FanDuel also means DraftKings is doing pretty well. Indeed, DraftKings prides in dominating 25% of the US online sport betting market share.

Some experts doubt DraftKings will live up to its potential now that brick and mortar casinos are back in operation. But there’s a high chance it will prove these critics wrong. Although Land-based casinos have a huge audience, growing statistics show more Americans are choosing mobile over in-person sports betting.

In New Jersey, for example, 80% of the $5B betting handle recorded in 2019 came from mobile bettors. This is the case for Pennsylvania, DC and a few more states. People are adopting mobile betting in droves, which could improve DraftKings’ stock price from the current $60 to $100 or more.

### 2. DraftKings

If you’re looking for an untapped company with tremendous growth opportunities, think about Esports Entertainment Group. Based on its stock price alone, Malta-based Esports Entertainment is headed for better days.

At the start of last year, this company’s stock was valued at roughly $4. Then it shot up to $17 by March this year. It has since corrected to $8 but this isn’t to say it’s on a free fall. Esports is a new industry that just hit the $1B valuation a couple of years ago.

This year, experts predict the industry will grow by 15%. In terms of adoption, eSports could welcome up to 729M millions by early next year. The growth will be fueled by corporate sponsorships and live-streaming capabilities.

All the same, what this growth means is that eSports betting websites like EEG could grow in the long term as well. Beware, though, loads of betting websites are embracing eSports betting. As such, EEG’s market share will reduce over time.

### 3. Esports Entertainment Group

If you’re looking for an untapped company with tremendous growth opportunities, think about Esports Entertainment Group. Based on its stock price alone, Malta-based Esports Entertainment is headed for better days.

At the start of last year, this company’s stock was valued at roughly $4. Then it shot up to $17 by March this year. It has since corrected to $8 but this isn’t to say it’s on a free fall. Esports is a new industry that just hit the $1B valuation a couple of years ago.

This year, experts predict the [industry will grow by 15%](https://influencermarketinghub.com/esports-stats/). In terms of adoption, eSports could welcome up to 729M millions by early next year. The growth will be fueled by corporate sponsorships and live-streaming capabilities.

### 4. Gamesys Group

Gamesys is one of the biggest gambling brands in the UK. Last year, its stock price plummeted after its brick-and-mortar casinos were shut down. But it managed to recover significantly toward the end of the year mainly due to the solid performance of its online brands.

Considering the gambling industry is projected to climb in the next five years, Gamesys can be a safe bet. It’s a high-cap brand. And as a result, there’s a high chance its stock will climb. However, it’s an expensive stock and it might not surge as much as its smaller competitors.

### 5. MGM Resorts

If you would love to own a part of Las Vegas, consider investing in one of the biggest brands in the desert: MGM Resorts. This company is always looking for investment opportunities, which is how it became the largest casino in Vegas.

Unlike some of its competitors, MGM Resorts owns an online casino. In fact, it’s constantly acquiring licenses in every state legalizing online gambling. Last year, MGM also made brave decisions by selling a significant chunk of its real estate holdings to focus on casino operations. That said, the brand’s track record and overall stocks growth show it’s a great buy for long-term speculation.

MiracleMagnet,"**Understand and constantly remind yourself that** ***emotions*** **should** ***never*** **be brought to the trading table ever!** This is one of the key rules when trading. This has been emphasised by many top traders and professional finance managers. Many fail in the forex industry because they get emotionally attached to their trades. When you bring emotions to the table, you are not making informed decisions based on facts and logic, so this increases the likelihood of losing the trade. Learn to leave your emotions at the door (so to speak); so this means not getting angry, shocked, upset, overexcited and not falling in love with any charts or currency pairs. Even though you may have favourite pairs that you enjoy trading, try your best not to get attached as they can break your heart ‘in a heartbeat’ - if you’re not careful.

**A habit that was very helpful - making** ***prediction trades*** **or paper trades (not real trades).** Helps with your mind frame on the industry because the more you do this the better you get, the more you learn and the more confident you are. When a person is confident, good things usually happen to them and in this case your trading improves and that equates to more success.

**When starting out, it’s crucial to understand that the money will not come straight away but it will eventually.** It’s easy to get carried away because of the excitement of starting this new forex journey and wanting to be profitable right away - it cannot work like that - you have to start slow and steady. One way this was achieved was to *prove* to myself that I could gain *pips* and percentages - not the money. Understanding that pips make the money, you’ll also know that if you can consistently accumulate the pips then the money will follow. Do not get greedy; learn your craft before you focus on the money.

**One important habit in forex and life in general is exercising** ***self-control*** **and having** ***patience.*** These are key factors and major characteristics that are needed to be a great trader - it’s like waiting for a bus; another setup will come in five minutes (well probably longer but you get the drift). Sitting on our hands a lot of the time is part of package.

**Do** ***tests*** **and exercises to stimulate the brain every now and then.** This is a great tactic to put you in the frame of mind of knowing that this is serious and that you need to revise, research and train for forex. An example of a test would be to set yourself 10 questions to answer weekly, almost like an exam when you were in college. This will help keep the mind fresh on key aspects of the industry.

barryriley,"I've been pointlessly building a savings account for my children to go to college in about 12 years. I'm putting about 150 Euros a month in at the moment which will increase in time (I'm EU based).

Obviously I'm earning 0 interest and so am looking at putting this in to an index fund that tracks the S&amp;P500 instead. I'm confused however about how I actually go about doing this and have some questions. 

I downloaded Plus500 and played with the demo account to see if I could get my head around it.

1) Is the US500 (Indeces) the same as the S&amp;P500. If not, what's the difference? There is no S&amp;P500 listed on the app in my locality. 
2) I'm confused by the leverage. I don't want to leverage anything. I want the money I invest to be invested, not more which would open me up to potential losses over my assets (although unlikely obviously in an index fund). However, when I go to buy in the demo, the only option is to leverage at 1:20. I can't just say ""Ok, put 150 in to this"" for example). 

These things lead me to believe that I've been looking in the wrong place. Looking at this link it appears that the things I'm looking at on PLUS500 are no index funds

https://money.stackexchange.com/questions/110740/where-can-i-invest-into-sp500-without-leverage

So where do I go to invest a small amount every month in to an Index fund without leverage? Do I have to walk in to my bank or can I do it through an app?

Unfortunately, we cannot open a fund in Brazil due to compliance with legal requirements. We would need the appointment of 3 managers of large funds and at least 5 million dollars: something practically impossible for us.

Siixteentons,"After looking at tax brackets for long term capital gains, I believe that married couples with income of less than $110k should be capturing their gains every year until they hit $110k total income. 

For married filing jointly with a taxable income of less than $80k, the tax on long term capital gains is 0%. With the standard deduction of $24k, that means your income can be up to $104k before your would start paying taxes on long term capital gains. Add in some above the line deductions like HSA contributions, traditional 401k contributions, health insurance premiums, student loan interest, and any tuition and you can easily exceed the $110k income number that I used earlier. 

If your income is less than that amount you could sell your holdings until your realized gains reach that limit  and you would pay 0% tax on them. You could immediately rebuy them at a new cost basis and continually do this year after year until your income exceeds the limit. then when you finally sell, you would be using a much higher cost basis than if you held through all those years. 

Obviously you could do this if you were single as well, but all the amounts would be halved due to the lower tax thresholds.

Is anyone out there doing this? Is there something I'm missing? Some of my investments will reach long term status at the beginning of the year and I can't see any reason not to sell and buy them back since I'm well below the $80k taxable income limit.",1,"If you make less than $110k and are married, you should be taking long term capital gains every year from your taxable accounts, I think?"

Your_Mom1111,"I am 18 years old and a sophomore in college (in the USA). I am a business major, as business/investing has been pretty much a passion for me since I discovered it. I love the field and enjoy it. 

I started getting into stocks when I was 16. I also did an internship at a company that summer and was able to “shadow” the owner to see what running a company is like. Learned a lot and it was interesting even though it was only a month there. Wish it could be longer, it was a different country too. 

After a year of investing and researching the stock market every single day, I decided to make the big jump and start an e-commerce store. I was still under 18 and had to use my parents behalf to start it. It was a big jump. The website and products were great, but the only issue was that I didn’t know how to drive traffic and customers that were going to make a purchase. I didn’t know how to market my products. And just because a business is visually good it doesn’t mean that the business can perform well. Starting my own business was great, I learned more in those 2 months (I know its short) than I did in my freshman year of college. 

This was the only issue, however I did learn how important every part of a business is., and how one bad part of a business can cause it to fail. I also had to learn some basic marketing stuff on my free time. 

So for the next year and a half I started to get involved in any sort of investing I can do at my age. 
Ive created business models/ideas as well on the side to safe as future reference.

respectfulskeptic,"
   House Democrats proposed several changes to retirement accounts as part of a push to make the tax code more equitable and raise money for their $3.5 trillion budget plan.
    Among them, the reforms would end “backdoor” and “mega-backdoor” Roth strategies for the wealthy and add new rules for individuals with retirement savings over $10 million.
    The legislation would also disallow IRA investments that require owners to be accredited investors.


House Democrats proposed a slew of changes to retirement accounts for the rich on Monday, part of a restructuring of the tax code tied to a $3.5 trillion budget plan.

Taken together, Democrats’ reforms aim to erode the use of retirement accounts as a perceived tax shelter for the wealthy and instead promote them as a way for low- and middle-income Americans to build a nest egg.

Most of the changes would start in 2022.

Wealthy individuals with retirement accounts exceeding $10 million would be prohibited from contributing extra savings and would have a new required minimum distribution each year, according to an outline of tax legislation unveiled Monday by the House Ways and Means Committee.

House Democrats propose corporate tax rate of 26.5%

The bill would also repeal so-called Roth conversions in individual retirement accounts and 401(k)-type plans for those making more than $400,000 a year. It would also prevent savers from using the “mega-backdoor Roth” strategy, regardless of income level.

Further, the legislation would prohibit individual retirement accounts from holding investments that require buyers to be accredited investors, a status generally reserved for wealthy investors.

The proposals are part of a broader theme of raising taxes on those who earn more than $400,000 a year to help pay for education, climate, paid-leave, child-care and other measures while also making the tax code more equitable.

They also follow Democrats’ outcry following a recent ProPublica report that Peter Thiel, a PayPal co-founder, owns a Roth IRA that had grown to $5 billion in 2019, up from less than $2,000 in 1999.

“IRAs were designed to provide retirement security to middle-class families, not allow the super wealthy to avoid paying taxes,” Sen. Ron Wyden, D-Ore., chair of the Senate Finance Committee, said in July after a data release showing growth of “mega” IRAs.

Democrats have narrow margins within which to pass a bill, which they aim to do with a simple majority via a budget reconciliation maneuver.

Republicans remain staunchly opposed. Rep. Kevin Brady, R-Texas, ranking member of the Ways and Means Committee, framed the spending as the “greatest expansion of the welfare state in our lifetimes” during a Thursday hearing, saying that it “wastes hard-earned tax dollars.”
Contribution limits

Current law lets taxpayers make IRA contributions regardless of account size.

However, the legislation would prohibit individuals from making more contributions to a Roth IRA or traditional IRA if the total value of their combined IRA and defined-contribution plan exceeds $10 million. A defined-contribution plan is a 401(k) plan or other similar workplace savings plan.

The policy’s purpose would be “to avoid subsidizing retirement savings once account balances reach very high levels,” according to a proposal outline.

That limit would apply to single taxpayers with more than $400,000 of taxable income. The threshold would be $450,000 for married taxpayers filing jointly and $425,000 for heads of household.
RMDs for ‘mega’ IRAs

Individuals whose combined traditional IRA, Roth IRA and defined-contribution retirement accounts exceed $10 million at year’s end would have to withdraw at least 50% of the excess the following year.

Those with account totals exceeding $20 million must pull from Roth IRAs and 401(k) plans first.

These new required minimum distributions for mega IRAs would only be required for savers whose taxable income exceeds the same thresholds identified above for the contribution limits.
Backdoor Roth

There are income limits to contribute to Roth IRAs. In 2021, single taxpayers can’t add money to such accounts if their income exceeds $140,000.

But current law allows for “backdoor” contributions to Roth IRAs. That can be achieved by converting a traditional IRA or Roth 401(k) account, which don’t carry income limits. There are income limits that determine whether contributions to traditional IRAs are tax-deductible or not.

Savers pay tax on the conversions, but their future investment growth and retirement distributions are tax-free.

The legislation would end the backdoor Roth IRA strategy by eliminating Roth conversions for both IRAs and workplace plans such as 401(k) plans.

The policy would apply at the same income thresholds listed above. It would count for distributions, transfers and contributions made in taxable years beginning after Dec. 31, 2031.
Mega backdoor Roth

The so-called “mega-backdoor Roth” strategy uses a principle similar to that of the backdoor Roth.

The strategy lets high earners save up to $58,000 in a 401(k) plan — more than the traditional $19,500 contribution limit — using a type of after-tax 401(k) bucket. Savers then convert that savings to a Roth account, once again yielding the benefit of tax-free investment growth.

Democrats’ legislation would end the mega-backdoor Roth by prohibiting all after-tax contributions in workplace plans and prohibiting after-tax IRA contributions from being converted to a Roth account.

This policy would apply for everyone, regardless of income level.
Accredited investors

Democrats’ legislation would disallow IRA investments that require the owner to have a minimum level of assets or income, or to have completed a minimum level of education or obtained a specific license or credential.

This would apply, for example, to accredited investors seeking to buy a private investment.

IRAs with these investments would lose their IRA status — meaning they’d lose their tax benefits.

These rules would apply starting in 2022, but there’d be a two-year transition period for IRAs already holding these investments.",1,"House Democrats propose new retirement plan rules for the rich, including contribution limits and a repeal of Roth conversions"

Beijing wants to break up Alipay, the 1bn plus-user superapp owned by Jack Ma’s Ant Group, and create a separate app for the company’s highly profitable loans business, in the most visible restructuring yet of the fintech giant.

Chinese regulators have already ordered Ant to separate the back end of its two lending businesses, Huabei, which is similar to a traditional credit card, and Jiebei, which makes small unsecured loans, from the rest of its financial offerings and bring in outside shareholders. Now officials want the two businesses to be split into an independent app as well.

The plan will also see Ant turn over the user data that underpins its lending decisions to a new credit scoring joint-venture which will be partly state-owned, according to two people familiar with the process.

“The government believes big tech’s monopoly power comes from their control of data,” said one person close to financial regulators in Beijing. “It wants to end that.”

The move may slow down Ant’s lending business, with the enormous growth of Huabei and Jiebei partly powering its planned IPO last year. The CreditTech unit, which includes the two units, overtook Ant’s main payment processing business for the first time in the first half of 2020, to account for 39 per cent of the group’s revenues.

VMS+ 3.0 is a hardware/software system compatible with any echocardiogram that transforms 2D and 3D ultrasound images into MRI-equivalent full 3D models of the heart. 

VPT recently announced their joint venture with General Electric Healthcare to place their software on GE's ultrasound machines. Just capturing 1% of this specific market is $2,000,000,000 in sales.

Its current valuation of USD$50 million is also small change for large players and this may result in an attractive exit strategy if an acquisition goes through.

So if I buy a $10,000 bond with a coupon rate of 10%, yearly coupon is $1,000 interest income. But I also want to buy this $10,000 bond for a discounted price. Let’s say $6,000 discount bond price.

If I bought the bond at a premium, let’s say $10,300. My yield is lower. ($1000/$10300) = .097

TwatBrah,"As we know the demand for semiconductors is only set to grow over the long-term. Additionally supply constraints and geopolitics has prompted new fab construction in Europe and the US. The shortage of chips for the European cars industry coupled with the fact that EV's leverage computing power far more than combustion has really lit the fire under EU governments. This coincides with the deployment of the 750 billion euro recovery fund a lot of which is earmarked for investment in ""digitization"" and technology as well as the explicit goal of EU govts to increase domestic chip production. Certainly there is a fairly unique confluence of positive factors for the chip industry in Europe. 

ASML (the worlds most advanced supplier of industrial equipment for chipmaking) has grown in value for some time now and I wonder if a lot of said factors are priced in. Its subcontractor Carl Zeiss which is among the world leaders in optics technology has also seen its stock value increase but not by as much despite being crucial for advanced litography and frankly, in my estimation, far ahead of the competition.

I'm thinking about the potential upside but what keeps me back is the fact that: 1 despite being high-value-added there is only so much potential demand for advanced optics, lasers and such and 2 the highly specialized engineering cannot be scaled up in the same way, say car or battery production can.

embrace-ur-elements,"Hi everyone. I want to make a simple point and have a debate about the SP500 valuation.  Basically, the big question we all have to ask ourselves is what is the longterm annualized return on the SP500 if we invest at these levels? I have seen people calculate this based on the current forward PE estimate and I believe this is highly dangerous!

Here is the common argument I see on here:

SP500 forward PE is at 22. Therefore we have a 4.5% earnings yield. Then given historical real earnings growth of the SP500 of 2%, we should see a 6.5% real return if investing at these levels. This isn't bad comparing to negative real yield offered by TIPs. And a measily nominal yield of 1.34% nominal yield of the 10yr. Therefore SP500 is fairly attractive. 

However, I don't think we should be assuming the real earnings implied by the forward PE is a reasonable starting place for this calculation. Now, I wouldn't be surprised if this is what we see in the next couple of years, but can we really assume this will last? Current forward PE of 22 on SP500 at 4500 means we expect to see 205 in real earnings which I will argue cannot last outside of the next few years.

Instead here are what I believe to be more accurate depiction of what the true earnings will be going forward on a real, averaged level. This will determine forward annualized returns.

**Estimate 1: 2019 real earnings is 140.  (Also max real earnings of SP500 is 140).**

This isn't the most reliable estimate but it is telling. The reason that it is telling is that it is the pre-covid earnings of the SP500 and recent. Not only that but it is also the all time high real earnings for the SP500 and occurs after a period of recovery fueled by extreme debt. Now of course 2019 is backward looking so if we account using a 2% real earnings growth rate, then we get to 148 in SP500 real earnings going forward.

**Estimate 2: CAPE Ratio is 40 implying 112.5 in real earnings for 10 year average. Adjusting for earnings growth the ratio is 36.5 implying 120 in real earnings.**

Now CAPE ratio, as it is the PE ratio with E being the average of the last 10 years of inflation adjusted earnings, is somewhat backward looking. Although it does account for inflation it does not account for natural growth in earnings. If we take the historical geometric mean of 2% annualized real earnings growth and adjust CAPE for this, then the CAPE ratio is 36.5 or about 120 in real earnings. This better reflects what earnings are likely to be going forward. Personally I believe this estimate to be the most fair measurement.

**Forward PE predicts 205 in real earnings for SP500.**

This tells me one should not use the forward PE for SP500 to forecast the earnings of the SP500 for the next decade as it would be 50% above all time high earnings that occurred in 2019. It is also 70% more than 10 year averaged earnings (with an adjustment for earnings growth and inflation to make it more realistic).

So we cannot possibly expect forward PE to give us a meaningful idea of the levels we are investing in! The danger is that forward PE may convince investors they will likely earn a 6.5% long term real annualized return (say 30 years) by investing at these levels and maybe a drawdown to say a 10PE would only mean a 50% decline.

However, more realistically, investors in SP500 will likely have a 4.7% real long term annualized return say (30 years) by investing in the SP500. Also if we are to revert to a 10 CAPE this could imply a crash as big as 75% in the near to medium term.

**TL;DR**

Your long term rate of return for the SP500 at these levels will not be 10% real. It will not even by 6.5% real which using the forward PE might imply. Instead it will likely be closer to 4.7% real with the risk of a drawdown as big as 75% in the near to medium term.

Now I'm not saying to hold cash, gold, crypto or whatever instead. I think stocks are the most sensible long term investment still because a 4.7% real return is still nice. However, they aren't for everyone! You will only realize this level of return in the long term and in the interim your portfolio could be down 50-75% meaning you would have a HEFTY penalty if you had to take out early. So is this hefty penalty worth it for the 5% real return? This is what we must ask.",1,Forward PE Estimate for SP500 will fall short over next 10 years

I'm interpreting that at this point the suppliers are crediting the company or that the clients payed in advance for the services that are about to be provided.

ThorDansLaCroix,"Urban construction, modernisation and so, is the main investment done by governments to boost the economy, because urbanisation attracts investments and cities created big consume demands. But these investments are the major forces leasing to the main crises at least since 1870.

When France economy was starting getting weak in the middle of XIX century they invested in modernising Paris is a huge scale. It workerd to attract investment and to create demand for business but eventually it lead to the late 1860s crises resulting the the famous Paris Commune. The war against Bismark's Prussia was an other way to attempt to invest the eccess of capital.

The very same strategy was the urban development in NY and other major cities in America leading and the property crisis in the midle of 1920s preciding the big economic crash.

The  american suburb development in the 1940s excluding minorities, especially the black community,  and the bored suburb middle class kids, lead the 68 protests.

After changes in the economy for a more Neoliberal strategy, giving much more power to capitalists acumulation investments in urban development became more frequent and so the cycle of crisis.

The crisis of 1973 originated in a global property market crash; it wasn't really the oil prices as mainstream economics like to suggest. The property crash happen 6 months before the oil price hike and recession was well under way by the fall.

Commercial property lead the Savings and Loan crisis of the late 1980s in the US.

The end of Japan boom in 1990 corresponded to a collapse of land prices.

Nationalisation of Swedish banking system in 1992 because of eccess in property markets.

One of the teiggers for the collapse in East and South East Asia in 1997-98 was the eccessive urban development in Thailand.

Since urbain development have been intensified in the past 20 years I assume that keeping an eye on the property market is a good idea as a sinal for major crisis approaching.

The greater the share of property markets in GDP, the more significant the connection between financing and investment in the built environment becomes a major source of macro crisis.

In the US where housing mortgage was equivalent of 40% of GDP it mostly certainly generated  a crisis in 2007-09.",1,Major crisis were led by property crisis.
JonDyna965,"Seeing the current situation, I strongly believe that the demand for copper will just keep on rising, so the prices will also rise unless we find more copper or some other economic alternative.

This brings me to the question about the possibility of the supply to meet the demand. Copper is important for the production of electronic devices and of renewable sources of energy. To add to that, it is also important for everything that’s electric, manufacturing batteries, and even for solar panels. There is a high demand for it and it is unlikely that it will go down soon.

There are a lot of big mining companies that are producing massive amounts of copper such as Codelco. Just last year, Codelco was the largest producer of copper, producing 1.73 million tonnes, which was 1.3% higher than their last year’s performance. BHP, which owns the world’s largest copper mine, comes in second producing 1.77 million tonnes.

A lot of smaller companies are joining as well too, and are in for producing tons of the metal too as shown by their drilling results. I believe that these smaller and new companies will contribute greatly to the copper supply boost, which will also help ease the situation of the rising prices.

Among them is Three Valley Copper ([TVC.V](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/tvc.v/)), a Canadian company producing pure copper cathodes from its mineral reserves. They recently released their second-quarter results, where they announced that they were able to mine 178,105 tonnes of ore at a grade of 0.50% from Don Gabriel. The company expects high unit costs throughout the year until next year since they are aiming to operate below capacity until Papomono Masivo is in full production.

As years go by, I believe copper is going to be really critical and will be a mainstay in a lot of industries. I know that a lot of companies are striving to meet the demand for this metal, but if it does not match the rate of the increase on demand for copper, the supply will likely be short and the prices will continue to increase.",1,The demand for copper against the copper supply

sxrg,"Hello,

Like the title says, I am curious about how the futures rollovers work particularly in the context of ES and NQ.

I see it appears that contracts for the next quarter begin trading today (9/9/21) for Dec expiry contracts. But that doesn't mean the contracts expiring next week have stopped trading. When does the ""roll"" for trading normally compete for Sept contracts? A week before expiry (ie tomorrow, Friday), or Wednesday before expiry..?

Were contracts for Dec and further forward expiry already trading prior to today or no?

Is the typical effect on the price as the contract expiration nears convergence to spot? Is it not the case that everyone who does not intend to actually take delivery will effectively begin to evaporate from the market as the expiration date nears? What's the last day for which those who do not intend to take delivery actively trade?(assuming T-1 to expiry but not sure)

Sorry if these are overly simplistic questions I don't have experience with futures contracts and any answers would be helpful and appreciated. Thank you.",1,Can someone please explain futures rollovers
The_Curious_Investor," Just a quick guide on things to look at in a stock (15 points), when researching, analyzing or performing DD on a stock, to help you avoid a P&amp;D. This post is from [r/FluentInFinance](https://www.reddit.com/r/FluentInFinance/) but thought it would be helpful to share here also, because I see a lot of pump &amp; dumps I see on reddit! Hopefully this helps someone! 

**Original post:**

A lot of investors having been asking questions on what to look at when considering a stock, and where to find the information, so I put this guide together on the things I look at. I'm just a regular guy who's been investing for about 19 years, with a degree in finance/ accounting, and working in the finance field. I hope this helps.

There points below are basically the things I cover when I look at a stock, and where I get them from. (This list is in no particular order. Below is just my preference. Everyone's ""recipe"" is different. Find what works for you!

* **Know the company.** I also use google to find out as much as a company as possible. What do they do? How do they make money? Why are they important? What are their products?

1. Positives? Strengths? Moat? Advantages? Opportunities? Growth? Catalysts?
2. Downside? Negatives? Concerns? Weaknesses? Threats? Risks?

* **Growth**. I look into the financials to look at past growth. I look into news, 10Q's, 10Ks, investor presentations, and statements to look for future growth. I find out out new products, or a changing landscape. How will the company scale?
* **Financial health**. Are the financials strong? Is the company financially healthy? Are cash flows from operations positive? How are Investing &amp; Financing Cashflows? Is net income growing? Are profit margins Getting better? Is the Quick ratio over 2 to sustain operations? Is EPS growing? Income Statement Trend, etc.

* **Earnings &amp; revenue history.** Is there growth? Is there potential? I look at the financials and the projections. Have they missed earnings? Have they beat earnings? Has earnings remained flat or grew consistently?

* **Charts Analysis and the technical indicators**. I am curious about what the charts have to say about momentum, and what prior prices and charting have to say about price prediction. I try to read and interpret the charts to see what previous trading patterns can predict. What are the short-term, mid-term and long-term predictions? I look at RSI, moving averages, MACD, Stochastic Oscillator, etc.

* **CEO, Management Team and Leadership:** I check Glassdoor and Indeed to learn about the management of the company, and google their CEO. A CEO with low/ bad ratings is a bad sign
* **Short selling.** How much of this stock is sold short? Are people betting against it? If so, why are they?
* **What is the put/call ratio?** Are people betting against this stock? Then is so, research why. This might be reasons to be weary.

1. *ChartMill.com:* [https://www.chartmill.com/stock/quote/AAPL/ownership](https://www.chartmill.com/stock/quote/AAPL/ownership)  


* How many **ETFs** that hold this stock? Will they continue to buy it up and drive price?

1. ETFDB: [https://etfdb.com/stock/AAPL/](https://etfdb.com/stock/AAPL/)  


* **Recent News**. I Google the company and look at recent articles. What are people saying? What are bloggers saying? What is the news saying? Any new news? Bad news? Good News? Reasons for movement in recent stock price?

* **Average volume** traded. Is this stock liquid? Would I be able to get my money back? How easy can I trade it. How large/small are the bid/ask spreads?

That is over $5bn in assets **per employee of Tether**

If that seems comically low it's because it is. It's a world record for total amount of money managed per employee.

The only similarly small number of employees for such a large amount of money under management was Bernie Madoff's ponzi scheme, which had $50bn under management with just 25 employees. [Source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Madoff_investment_scandal)

\-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

What benefit is there to having such a low number of employees? Lower costs yes but with the money they control and need to invest surely it would make sense for them to have more than just 13 employees doing this?

Or is it because it's easier for them to conceal fraud when there's only a handful of people being exposed to it and most of them have a large interest in keeping the fraud going.

Tether has just under $30bn in commercial paper ([source](https://www.ft.com/content/342966af-98dc-4b48-b997-38c00804270a)) which makes it one of the largest US commercial paper market investors in the entire world, alongside the likes of Vanguard (17,600 employees) and BlackRock (16,500 employees). **THIRTEEN EMPLOYEES EVALUATING THE CREDITWORTHINESS OF NEARLY 30BN IN COMMERCIAL PAPER LOANS AND WITHOUT THE OVERSIGHT OF AUDITING.**

Hi everyone!

I would like to tell you about my experience of investing in P2P lending platforms.

During my studies in the EU, my fellow students introduced me to the investments in P2P lending platforms.

2019 was the year of the lowest interest rates on deposits in the EU- fluctuated around 0.5-1% per annum, and this has been around for more than 2 years.

While all of them were receiving interest rates 20 times higher than in banks.

Everything got to the point that my fellow students, being EU citizens, began to take loans in banks and invest these funds in these microloans.

Sounds crazy, but it works for now.

I decided to try.

Having invested 8K, in 18 months I received 1258 Euros of income, which amounted to about 10.5% per annum.

After moving back to the United States, I discovered new opportunities with Prosper.

It was a terrible experience.

On Mintos, I was not limited in the amount of investment, and most importantly, I did not have any time limits, since the vast majority of loans were microloans for a short period (up to 2 months).

But in Prosper, you could invest for a period starting from 36 months, and the fee could reach up to 2%, in Mintos it is fixed at 0.85%.

In the end, I was refused because I could not show my gross income over 80.000 $ Plus.

Also, there was no secondary market on Prosper where you could quickly and with a premium resell your investment.

Fortunately, I still have a European SEPA bank account in Euros and continue to invest in Mintos.

Of course, the system is not perfect:

1) You can earn more than 12% (the maximum that can be earned on the platform is 30% per annum), but then you get into loans with a rating of C- and below, and defaults can sometimes reach more than 30%.

After all, the risk is all yours!

2) When transferring money to a European bank from the United States, after I left the EU, I had slight difficulties.

My payment was frozen by the bank due to suspected money laundering. I had to submit documents on the origin of money through the Bank of America, and explain why, being in the USA and being a US citizen, I transfer money to a European bank, and for what purposes it will be used. It is good that they did not demand to obtain a license for investment activities.

3) When converting from Dollars to Euros and from Euros to Dollars, you have to lose up to 4%.

From now on, I intend to increase my investment to 20K dollars, I will continue to invest in Mintos, and also try a new platform that uses crypt and promises interest rates two times higher than the European one.  


I will try to write monthly reports.

djarnexus,"So, using smart asset, I figured that my marginal tax rate is around 35%. If I sell $10k worth of RSUs right at the vest, $2.2k (22%) should have already withheld for me at the vest. My actual tax responsibility was $3.5k (35%). So this means that I would need to withhold $1.3k of what I sold to pay taxes at tax season.

If my usual tax return is about $1k, I'd now owe $300.

So on that sale of $10k, I actually keep $8.7k. If I didn't sell, I'd still be responsible for paying the $1.3k.

Are my math and reasoning correct here?

I.e., I'd need to always sell an extra 13% of my shares to pay for taxes at vest; I keep 87% of what I sell.",1,RSUs and Taxes - What's the Math?

Sources said the decision to freeze new video game approvals was revealed at a meeting between Chinese authorities and industry giants Tencent and NetEase
It is unclear how long this suspension of new game approvals will last, the sources said  
  
The Chinese government has temporarily suspended approval for all new online games in the country, dealing a fresh blow to the video gaming businesses of industry giants Tencent Holdings and NetEase, as Beijing steps up measures to tackle gaming addiction among young people, according to people with knowledge of the matter.  
That decision was revealed during a meeting on Wednesday called by Chinese authorities, led by the publicity department of the Chinese Communist Party and gaming watchdog the National Press and Publication Administration (NPPA), to discuss with representatives from Tencent and NetEase how they will implement Beijing’s new restrictions on video gaming for minors, according to a person briefed on the matter, but declined to be named because the information is private.

don_cornichon,"I know this is more a trading/gambling topic than investing, but humor me please.

I read about call/put options here all the time, but I've never once seen anyone mention more ""exotic"" derivatives like Knock Out warrants (which I discovered through my broker recently).

I'm curious if people don't use them because they feel they're an inferior choice, because their broker simply doesn't have them and they haven't heard of them, or another reason.

(In simple terms, A KO C 12/99 warrant is like a call option that doesn't have a time limit, doesn't have time or volatility value (no greeks), but does have a KO limit where the whole contract is void if the underlying ever once crosses that point.

For example, a KO warrant on the S&amp;P 500 index with a KO limit of 4400 would be worth around $1 at the moment because the index is at around 4500. If it rises to 4600, the warrant is worth around $2, doubling the investment while the underlying moves 2% (note that this is exponential (flattening, not parabolic) because basically 4400 is the new 0 and the stock is now 200 instead of 100), while if it dipped to 4399 = game over.)

Seeing as you trade one kind of risk (KO) for another (Time decay / No volatility), but the profit potential is much higher than with regular calls (if going for a KO limit close to the current price, not otherwise but then it becomes pretty safe instead), I'm fairly intrigued and will try it out soon.

mike_oc23,"Hi Everyone,

My main investing account is with another brokerage but I decided to set up a mini side portfolio with Robinhood (I know there are issues with Robinhood but it will work fine for what I'm doing). Since I want the majority of my money going towards my main account, I came up with a budget for my situation that will pretty much be unnoticeable in terms of DCA.

I am starting with $100 and splitting it evenly between AAPL, AMZN, GOOGL, MSFT, and TSLA so $20 on each of them. Then I'm setting a recurring investment of $1 for each of them weekly so $5/week or around $22/month. So it's pretty much the cost of a streaming service monthly. 

I back tested this scenario and was surprised to see how much it actually grew - from the initial $100 to $43.5k over the last 10yrs with just adding $22/month! I'm not expecting these companies to continue at the same growth rate moving forward but I am happy with my picks and obviously it can be adjusted based on preferences but I thought you all might like to see this scenario especially if you're young and don't have a lot of capital to put in.

ahmaddaud," Exhibiting in London today and featured on CoinMarketCap; if you haven't been introduced to DFL- Supercup sponsor Caizcoin just yet, it's high time to learn it's merits. It's big, it's bold and it's a revolution for many.

I've held back from posting about this currency up until now mainly due to two reasons:

* I don't believe in posting the ""merits"" of something until I am confident enough to invest in it myself
* In the Crypto-sphere you need approach new projects with caution lest they turn out to be over-hyped, or worse, scams

Yet, I have never felt so comfortable writing about a project as I do this one, with both those reasons flung out the window - and soon you will see why this is a great opportunity present.

### What is Caizcoin?

Access the whitepaper [here](https://member.caizcoin.com/white-paper).

Caizcoin's ""developer team collaborated closely with worldwide scholars, famous economists, business professionals, and IT experts to create Caizchain, an innovative blockchain"" (CMC, 2021). It features:

* low transaction fees,
* a distributed ledger,
* a top-notch consensus algorithm,
* and transaction speeds that outperform all current blockchains
* user-intuitive interface,
* extensively tested its API on different factors to assure high-quality performance and scalability

&amp;#x200B;

The added kick? It appeals to a vast population of Muslims who are in pursuit of 'Islamic Compliant Finance' for their investments- notably, gamble and interest free.

It is estimated that 20 to 30% of Muslim majority countries, from the Middle East and South Asia exclusively participate in 'Islamic finance' as a pose to conventional financial products which often have attached mechanisms of interest. The market for this project is certainly there.

&amp;#x200B;

### Why CAIZ?

The Crypto industry is volatile - that's no secret - but throw in a mix of malicious actors and rug-pulls, there is further dissuasion in participating or adopting. Notably however, on CoinMarketCap, the Caizcoin project is designed in a way to:

&gt;*...to create a moral platform will be highly advantageous to small investors looking for secure investments. The Caiz team has stated on several occasions that their creative financial solution will assist the Muslim crypto community in multiplying the returns on their investments and that it will be beneficial to everybody, regardless of their background or religious affiliation. - CMC, 2021*

What is key to note here is that the **project seeks to extend itself to all realms of society,** and what is NOT is a project exclusively for Muslims. That is it's focal point but the investment opportunity is there for all individuals regardless of religion or nationality.

fahrenheitc,"Redbubble is an ASX-Listed online marketplace for independent artists that provides printed products. Here was there recent investor presentation. Most of their customers are based in North America amd Europe. They are currently heavily undervalued at around $1.1B AUD ($800M USD).

https://cdn-api.markitdigital.com/apiman-gateway/ASX/asx-research/1.0/file/2924-02408798-3A573176?access_token=83ff96335c2d45a094df02a206a39ff4

The company currently has aggressive plans to grow their revenue to $1.5B AUD by 2024, afterwards focusing more efforts on raising margins. Their CAGR for the past 5 years has been 41% on average. Guidance until 2024 is around 20-30% CAGR. Their current revenue is around $657M AUD with a gross profit of $223M AUD. 

Here are some of their key selling points. 

Their business is being pushed by 3 key trends: a) they are an emerging winner in a rapidly shifting landscape (personalisation of e-commerce goods), b) this is reinforcing the inherent flywheel (network) effects and c) the shift to e-commerce and online has been accelerated by COVID - this is a structural change, we aren't going back

They have a very strong balance sheet and a nice cash buffer ($99M). They are cash flow positive, generating $51M EBITDA for FY21. 

The valuation multiple is still extremely low and enticing at circa 2x MP revenue, compared to comparators at 10x revenue or more. 

I want to emphasise the comparison between Etsy here because their business model is inherently similar, utilizing the incredibly rare flywheel effect between artists and customers. Their growth rate is also very similar. At current revenue, my estimates would put them at 3-4 years behind Etsy. 

Etsy Revenue (USD)

2015 - 273M 
2016 - 364M
2017 - 441M
2018 - 603M
2019 - 818M
2020 - 1.7B

Redbubble Revenue (AUD). 

2019 - 306M
2020 - 416M
2021 - 657M
2024 - 1.5B Target

Etsy's has appreciated 25x over the past 4-5 years. Not only did Etsy's valuation increase with its revenues, but also its revenue multiple too. The current difference in valuation between Etsy and RBL is around 37x. 

Mostly because RBL is listed on the ASX and relatively unknown globally (yet). Also because Australian funds are typically value investors. OTCMKTS is RDBBY. 

The Australian Tech scene is actually fairly well developed with Atlassian, Afterpay and Xero. Redbubble is shaping up to be the next giant, currently with a very attractive valuation that could yield significant returns in the upcoming years as they start to get noticed by the big NASDAQ players.",1,"ASX: RBL.

**Synopsis**

As Bitcoin creates waves, our team steps back to examine the origins of the cryptocurrency. Read our whitepaper to gain an in-depth understanding of the technology and it’s applicability.

In the last 10 years, concepts like blockchain and digital currencies have moved from small online communities to being supported by some of the world’s largest firms. These concepts and ideas were best presented by Satoshi Nakamoto in the creation of Bitcoin. With the rise in popularity, and the different offerings, MNP found it necessary to investigate what Bitcoin implementation best fits Nakamoto’s original vision.

Satoshi Nakamoto’s whitepaper “Bitcoin: A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System” sets the stage for our analysis. Nakamoto’s whitepaper, emails, forum posts, and original source code define the protocol — the rule set for Bitcoin as a data network — and the key elements that make Bitcoin a functional technology. Along with the whitepaper, we reviewed the publicly available emails, forum posts, and original code left by Nakamoto. We used these source materials to determine what Nakamoto’s original purpose for Bitcoin was – a global electronic cash system (that works peer-to-peer), while also laying the foundation for a network that can support more advanced data applications.

Using the sources mentioned above, we developed an assessment framework and related criteria assessing the relevance of the Bitcoin scripting language (including OpCodes incorporated in it), protocol elements, and capabilities in current implementations — Bitcoin SV (BSV) and Bitcoin Core (BTC) against Nakamoto’s original vision.

Our findings indicate that BSV is most representative of Nakamoto’s original intention and design for Bitcoin. One key factor is because the BSV blockchain demonstrates the ability to scale to support significant volumes of transactions in a timely manner for macro-payments and even micropayments, resulting from BSV’s “Genesis” hard fork in February 2020. This removed any arbitrary cap on block size and allows the BSV blockchain and transaction capacity to grow unbounded, while also removing state restrictions limits and improving the code base to allow for unbounded scaling. In addition, the Genesis hard fork restored key aspects of the original functionality of Bitcoin script, the programming language used within the Bitcoin protocol. In our whitepaper, we also identify what technology capabilities can be enabled once Nakamoto’s vision for Bitcoin has been fully realized.

A general outline of report is as follows:

* The Bitcoin Whitepaper
* Nakamoto’s known Forum Posts, Emails
* The Original Bitcoin Protocol
   * Capabilities
   * Critical components
   * Non-functional requirements
   * Implementation attributes
* Comparison of current Bitcoin implementations to Nakamoto’s original vision
* Impact of Nakamoto’s vision once fully realized.

Here is a couple of stocks that might be worth your  attention this week. They were selected using a couple of criteria –  most of them heavily rely an the company’s fundamentals; the analysts  recommendations are only provided as a kind of support for the  hand-picked names. This is why I’m calling the approach a **consensus strategy.**  The stocks I’m going to present you below are generally believed to  outperform the stock market in the coming months, they have a consensus  recommendation of Buy, their fundamentals are scored considerably better  than most stocks and their average target price by stock analysts is  above current market valuation.

In order to consider buying the stock’s shares, the following criteria need to be satisfied:

&amp;#x200B;

* **TheStreet score**: A+, A or A-
* **Zacks Rank**: 1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold)
* **Weiss Ratings recommendation**: A or B
* **Yahoo Finance recommendation**: at least mixed Buy/Hold
* **Yahoo Finance target price**: min. 5% higher than current price
* **Piotroski F-Score**: min. 4
* **InvestorsObserver Overall Score**: min. 50  
 

**Note**: Descriptions of those criteria are provided at the end of this post as well as [HERE](https://www.investing-scientist.com/research/top-stocks-to-buy-a-consensus-strategy/).             

&amp;#x200B;

If you decide to buy any of the below stocks, you might want to  consider the following selling conditions (at least one of them should  be satisfied):

* price is higher or close to target
* profit is in range 20% – 30%
* loss is higher than 50%
* TheStreet recommendation is changed to Sell
* Weiss Ratings recommendation is changed to Sell
* Yahoo Finance recommendation is changed to Sell

#### Now, a few words on the criteria I’m using and sources of data.

**1. TheStreet score**

The first filtering step is to get stocks with Buy recommendation at TheStreet stock screener. I’m only keeping stocks with A+, A or A- rating (top ones), although A-, B+, B and B- are Buys as well.

From thestreet.com:

***A (Excellent)*** *– The stock has an excellent track  record for maximizing performance while minimizing risk, thus delivering  the best possible combination of total return on investment and reduced  volatility. It has made the most of the recent economic environment to  maximize risk-adjusted returns compared to other stocks. While past  performance is just an indication — not a guarantee — we believe this  fund is among the most likely to deliver superior performance relative  to risk in the future as well.*

And about the methodology (source: https://www.thestreet.com/r/ratings/reports/detail/T.html):

*TheStreet Ratings’ stock model projects a stock’s total  return potential over a 12-month period including both price  appreciation and* ***dividends****. Our Buy, Hold or Sell  ratings designate how we expect these stocks to perform against a  general benchmark of the equities market and interest rates. While our  model is quantitative, it utilizes both* ***subjective*** *and* ***objective***  *elements. For instance, subjective elements include expected equities  market returns, future interest rates, implied industry outlook and  forecasted company earnings. Objective elements include volatility of  past operating revenues, financial strength, and company cash flows.*

**2. Zacks Rank**

It is required that the Zacks Rank is Hold, Buy or Strong Buy (so  we’re avoiding stocks with Sell and Strong Sell recommendations). The  Zacks Rating utilizes a completely different system, based on company  earnings-related data, in particular earnings estimate revisions and  earnings surprises, to predict profitability of holding the company’s  shares. More from https://www.zacks.com/education/stock-education/zacks-rank-guide-6:

*A portfolio of Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stocks has beaten the  market in 26 of the last 31 years with an average annual return of* ***+24.3%*** *a year; more than double that of the S&amp;P 500’s +10.6% .*

**3. Weiss Ratings recommendation**

We’re only keeping stocks with Buy (B) or Strong Buy (A) recommendation.

Wjat are these scores? This is what I found at their website:

*“A” Rating:* ***Excellent.*** *The company’s stock has  an excellent track record for providing strong performance with  lower-than-average risk, and it is trading at a price that represents  good value relative to the company’s earnings prospects. While past  performance is no guarantee of future results, our opinion is that this  stock is among the most likely to deliver superior performance relative  to risk in the future. Of course, even the best stocks can decline in a  down market. But our “A” rating can generally be considered the  equivalent of a “****Strong Buy****“.*

*“B” rating:* ***Good.*** *The company’s stock has a good  track record for delivering a balance of performance and risk. While  the risk-adjusted performance of any stock is subject to change, our  opinion is that this stock is a good value, with good prospects for  outperforming the market. Although even good investments can decline in a  down market, our “B” rating is considered the equivalent of a “****Buy****“.*

**4.  Yahoo Finance  recommendation and target price**

It is required that the Yahoo Finance  stock recommendation is at least mixed Buy/Hold from experts.  Additionally, the predicted target price (average, from experts) should  be at least 5% higher than the current one.

**5. Piotroski F-Score**

The Piotroski score is a number between 0-9 that reflects  nine criteria used to determine the strength of a company’s financial  situation, including profitability, leverage or operating efficiency.  Zero is the worst value and nine is the best. As we can read in[ Piotroski’s paper](https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/9dc9/b030da18ab28d1e1a1bbf7e33fb5911f189e.pdf) from 2000:

*In addition, an investment strategy that buys expected winners and shorts expected losers generates a* ***23% annual return*** *between 1976 and 1996, and the strategy appears to be robust across time and to controls for alternative investment strategies.*

It is required that the score is 4 or higher. The values were retrieved from gurufocus.

**6. InvestorsObserver Overall Score**

The rank has a value in between 0 and 100. It takes into account both **technical** analysis and **fundamental**  stock data. An Overall Rank of N means that a given company is rated  above N% of stocks, therefore the higher the number, the better. My  requirement is that the company has InvestorsObserver Overall score of  at least 50.

More detailed explanation from [t](https://www.investorsobserver.com/learning-center/what-the-scores-mean/what-does-the-overall-score-mean)heir website:

*The Overall Score combines our two technical scores  (Short Term and Long Term) with our Fundamental Score into one metric.  This makes our overall score a great place to start when evaluating  stocks, regardless of your investing style.*

*A low score doesn’t necessarily mean a stock is likely  to go down, just that our system doesn’t think there’s much of a bullish  case for it.*

Please note that the company profile data (short description) was taken from tradingview (sometimes I shortened it) and dividend data was retrieved from MarketBeat.

LobstahRolls,"Hi! Vanguard index holder here. My girlfriend's new job offered a 401K with a 3% contribution match for Capital Group: American Funds.

How do I pick the lesser of evils? None of these funds seem to track the S&amp;P 500. All funds seem to be heavily weighted with front loads and minimal returns compared to my (managed) Vanguard portfolio. I want to set her up for success but it's hard to do so when this is the only option her employer offers. Any suggestions on how to keep her portfolio fees low and based in American equities?

-prooof,"This is basic I know but I can't really put my finger on why we invest other than hoping people pay more for it later. My understanding is that a company cashes out when they IPO, they sell some shares on the public market and that's their profit to use as they choose. And then potentially they keep some shares private and if that grows, they can sell those shares as well (or issue new ones from thin air). But other than that, after the IPO, it's mostly just other people changing hands of shares- why would a company care what it's stock price / valuation is?",1,How does investing in a company actually impact the company itself?

On TDA you can assign any sale of stock to a specific purchase in the past. This enables one to manage which shares you are selling at any given time, as opposed to having the FIFO method execute your trade by default. First in first out (for those unaware). There are other methods such as LIFO (last in last out), High cost first out, low cost first out, etc....

I have been averaging into Draftkings as a long term position, but have found that I also enjoy swing trading the stock due to the fact that I have been holding it and have become rather familiar with its movements/patterns. I purchased a few extra shares back in May around $42-$43 for the sake of reselling sometime in the near future around 60. The plan worked as expected and I sold a handful of shares yesterday for around 63.50...TDA requires the user to log in the following day to adjust the tax lot method or to assign a sale to a specific purchase. The stock does not settle for a couple days and this can be done anytime prior to settlement after the day the stock was sold. So...With that being said. This is my question...I notice I have shares from back in March of this year as well with a higher average of around $60. I have my other shares from May and they have an average of $43. My main position was purchased awhile ago (last year), and is averaged around 50 with shares purchased all over the place. I guess I am wondering if it would be wise to sell the shares purchased at $60 back in March instead - I would barely be breaking even on them, locking in next to no profit, but would inadvertently lower my cost basis and would leave the profit I could have taken on the table. This is all for the sake of having those shares for 1+ years and being able to hold them comfortably without having to risk losing any of my initial investment/capital...Or would it be wiser to take the profit I can take off of the shares purchased in May at $40 and simply keep the others until the cost rises. I guess I feel like delaying the profit taking until the shares have matured in my portfolio for a year or more would be wise so I am not paying as much tax? If i take profit now I pay the tax on it. If I sell my higher cost shares and just barely break even (nothing to pay tax on here). This enables me to sell the other shares with a lower cost basis (and therefor a higher likelihood of being profitable) later on without having to be taxed on the profit.

gotta say I really liked what I found, and I think it could be a great long-term investment opportunity... but still wanted to hear people's thoughts about $DKNG. (I posted full analysis with pictures and more data at r/growthstonks)

# THE ONLINE BETTING industry 

The market is worth $67 billion today and is estimated to reach about $93 billion by 2023—growing at roughly 11.5% per annum.

There are few reasons for the aggressive growth, First, more of our activities are taking place online, a trend that extends to betting as well.

The second is regulation. The U.S. Supreme Court uplifted the Professional and Amateur Sports Protection Act in May of 2018 to legalize sports betting on a federal level. Since then, 25 states have legalized sports betting.

# SPORTS BETTING

The most popular activity by far is [sports betting](https://www.visualcapitalist.com/americas-multi-billion-dollar-sports-betting-industry/), which makes up over 40% of the total online betting market.

# DraftKings

DraftKings is a *sports betting*, *daily fantasy sports contest*, and an *iGaming* operator.

In total, DraftKings now operates sportsbooks in **14 states** and averages **1.5 million monthly unique paying customers** across its online sportsbooks, iGaming, and daily fantasy offerings.

# Financials

DraftKings's revenue keeps surging YOY, in Q2-2021 revenue reached $297,605M which is a 22% higher sales compared to the analyst expectations. last year the company delivered $74,998M in revenue.

The company also said that it had grown the number of monthly unique payers by 281% and the average revenue per monthly unique payer by 26%. In other words, fundamental growth was very strong.

Even though I really think that the potential for growth here is clear, the company still losing a lot of money, Cost of revenue spiked this quarter to $187,006M from $53,172M, and new loss reached $305,526M - even more than DraftKings's revenue.

Another positive point in DraftKings's favor is the amount of cash the company has gathered since 2018. The company currently has $2.65 billion in cash, which compared to last year's results - $1.24 billion, is a 113% change.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;In a sign of how far China’s leaders  have drifted from their revolutionary roots, the biggest shock gripping  the country today is that the ruling Chinese Communist Party (CCP) might  actually be socialist after all.  
&gt;  
&gt;The shakeup  centers on the phrase “common prosperity.” It was first introduced by  revolutionary leader Mao Zedong but has now been taken up as the  defining mantra of a new era as imagined by current strongman President  Xi Jinping.  
&gt;  
&gt;In an Aug. 17 speech to the CCP’s  Central Committee for Financial and Economic Affairs—his first since the  secretive, annual summer leadership conclave at the seaside town of  Beidaihe—Xi [declared](http://www.xinhuanet.com/english/2021-08/18/c_1310133051.htm)  that “Common prosperity is an essential requirement of socialism and a  key feature of Chinese-style modernization.” He used the phrase 15 times  in total in his address and it’s become a refrain ever since.  
&gt;  
&gt;[According](http://politics.people.com.cn/BIG5/n1/2021/0817/c1024-32197305.html) to the official *People’s Daily*,  the goal is to build a more egalitarian China by “expanding the  proportion of middle-income groups, increasing the incomes of low-income  groups, reasonably adjusting high incomes \[and\] banning illegal  incomes.” Nobody doubts that the CCP would also like to leverage common  prosperity to reassert its authority over China’s high-fliers.   
&gt;  
&gt;“These  billionaires and tech companies are very risky to the CCP because they  are seen as an alternative form of social and political power,” says  David Moser, associate dean of the Yenching Academy at Peking  University.

&gt;  
&gt;In response, skittish  investors have started dumping their stock. Up to $1 trillion has been  wiped off the valuation of Chinese firms since February, after  regulators began targeting electronic payment providers, real estate  developers, private tuition companies (a vast, $120 billion industry in  education-hungry China) and the gaming sector. The latter—a giant and  highly lucrative market generating $44 billion in earnings last year—is  now reeling from new directives banning children from playing more than  three hours of online games a week.  
&gt;  
&gt;It’s the  biggest socio-economic change since reformist leader Deng Xiaoping  unleashed market forces in the late 1970s. In words that have since  become infamous, Deng propelled the country’s export-driven resurgence  with the exhortation: “Let some people get rich first.” Many forget that  he went on to say that those allowed to achieve wealth would be  expected to “lead other regions and people to gradually achieve common  prosperity.” His successors now look poised to make good on the bargain.

&gt;  
&gt;A senior CCP official [said last month](https://www.scmp.com/economy/china-economy/article/3146438/chinas-common-prosperity-push-does-not-mean-killing-rich)  that “common prosperity” does not mean “killing the rich to help the  poor.” But rumors are swirling that Beijing may bring in property,  inheritance, and capital gains taxes to level the playing field in a  society where the top 1% now control 31% of wealth, according to Credit  Suisse—up from 21% two decades ago. The preferential 10% tax rate  enjoyed by internet companies is also expected to be rolled back in  favor of the standard 25% corporate rate.  
&gt;  
&gt;“Xi is  saying, ‘Hey, I found the magic sauce,'” explains Sung Wen-Ti, a  scholar specializing in the CCP leadership at the Australian National  University. “‘I’m going to continue to use this socialist market economy  to encourage economic growth, while redistributing wealth in a way that  doesn’t lead us back to the Mao Zedong days of poverty.’”

&gt;  
&gt;The meaning of common prosperity  
&gt;  
&gt;In July, [to mark the CCP’s centenary](https://time.com/6077358/china-communist-party-centenary-xi-jinping/),  Xi announced that the goal of building “a moderately prosperous society  in all respects” was complete, having already declared [absolute poverty eradicated](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-china-56194622#:~:text=Chinese%20President%20Xi%20Jinping%20says,been%20lifted%20out%20of%20poverty.).  By 2049, the centenary of the People’s Republic, the goal is to “build a  modern socialist country that is prosperous, strong, democratic,  culturally advanced and harmonious.”  
&gt;  
&gt;Of course,  “democratic” means different things in China than it does in the West,  but there’s no doubt that the goal of a “socialist country” is more  important to Xi than it was to his immediate predecessors. So far,  celebrities who flaunt their wealth and welch on taxes have found  themselves abruptly taken off the Chinese internet. Officials have also [announced](https://www.sixthtone.com/news/1008371/beijings-top-teachers-will-rotate-shifts-across-schools)  the ramping up of a scheme to rotate the best teachers among different  schools in order to equalize education standards. Ride-hailing firm Didi  and e-commerce platform JD.com have meanwhile moved to establish trade  unions for their staff, who until now have typically been employed  casually via third-party contractors, receiving paltry benefits. But the  central government has offered little specific guidance as to what  socialism and common prosperity mean in practice.   
&gt;  
&gt;The  vagueness mirrors an anti-corruption drive started by Xi in 2012.  Instead of new laws and regulations to ensure transparency and  accountability, that purge instead borrowed from the ancient Chinese  tactic of “kill a chicken to scare the monkeys,” says Moser—making an  example of [1.5 million officials](https://www.efe.com/efe/english/world/china-punishes-more-than-1-5-million-officials-for-corruption/50000262-3412841), a comparatively small number, to send a clear message to all 90 million apparatchiks that graft was no longer tolerated.  
&gt;  
&gt;This  is the context in which China’s wealthiest have been left to interpret  the implications of common prosperity for themselves. Unsurprisingly,  they have been throwing money at the problem, pouring billions into  charitable foundations as a gesture of appeasement.

That came on top of an earlier pledge of 100  billion renminbi from Tencent, and 10 billion renminbi from bosses at  each of Pinduoduo, Xiaomi and Meituan, for various social projects.  Alibaba had already been in the spotlight after regulators fined the  firm $2.8 billion and nixed the $37 billion IPO of its fintech arm, Ant  Group, which was subsequently ordered to restructure. Notably, the  firm—along with several of China’s most profitable corporations—is based  in Zhejiang province, chosen as “a demonstration zone for achieving  common prosperity,” [according](http://www.xinhuanet.com/english/2021-06/10/c_1310001320.htm) to the official Xinhua news agency.

&gt;“Xi  doesn’t want to be seen as someone who’s in league with these giant  tech companies and billionaires, so he’s cracking down on them,” says  Moser. “It’s a populist move so ordinary people feel the CCP is on their  side.”

&gt;SHANGHAI, Sept 6 (Reuters) - Bonds issued by indebted developer China Evergrande Group [**(3333.HK)**](https://www.reuters.com/companies/3333.HK) slumped on Monday after a ratings downgrade led to restrictions on their use as collateral, prompting China's stock exchanges to halt trade.  
&gt;  
&gt;The Shanghai Stock Exchange said in a statement that it had temporarily suspended trading in China Evergrande Group's 6.98% July 2022 corporate bond following ""abnormal fluctuations."" The exchange had also suspended trading in the bond on Friday.  
&gt;  
&gt;Shanghai exchange data showed the bonds sliding more than 25% to a low of 40.18 yuan after the resumption of trade on Monday afternoon. The company's 5.9% May 2023 Shenzhen-traded bond , which was also suspended, fell more than 35% after trading resumed.  
&gt;  
&gt;The slump in bond prices comes after a ratings downgrade erased the bonds' value for use in pledged repo trading.  
&gt;  
&gt;Rules governing pledged repos require bonds issued after April 7, 2017 and pledged as collateral to be rated AAA, while issuers must have credit ratings of AA or higher. Bonds issued before that date - including Evergrande's July 2022 bond - need only be rated AA or higher.  
&gt;  
&gt;China Chengxin International Credit Rating Co (CCXI) downgraded Evergrande and its onshore bonds to AA from AAA on Thursday, and placed the company and its bonds on a watchlist for further downgrades.  
&gt;  
&gt;On Friday, China Securities Depository and Clearing Co. (CSDC) reduced the ""conversion ratio"" of the July 2022 bond to zero, effective Sept. 7. Other Evergrande bonds were not included in CSDC's table of conversion ratios on Friday as they no longer qualified for inclusion.  
&gt;  
&gt;The conversion ratio determines leverage limits for repo financing given a specific bond pledged as collateral. CSDC is owned by the Shanghai and Shenzhen stock exchanges.  
&gt;  
&gt;A director at a local brokerage said that the reduction in the conversion ratio was a ""grey rhino"" - a highly obvious yet ignored threat. ""It was bound to happen.""  
&gt;  
&gt;Evergrande declined to comment. But in a statement on the Shanghai Stock Exchange on Monday, it acknowledged the impact of the rating downgrade on the bonds' use as pledged repo collateral. It said the bonds had previously been deemed appropriate only for qualified institutional investors, and the downgrade had no impact on investor suitability.  
&gt;  
&gt;Worries surrounding Evergrande, which has been scrambling to raise funds to pay lenders and suppliers, have grown into broader concerns that a debt crisis could send shockwaves through China's banking system.",1,China Evergrande bonds suspended as prices plunge.

Coupa has not reconciled its expectations for non-GAAP income from operations to GAAP loss from operations, or non-GAAP net income per diluted share attributable to Coupa Software Incorporated to GAAP net loss per share attributable to Coupa Software Incorporated because certain items excluded from non-GAAP income from operations and non-GAAP net income per diluted share attributable to Coupa Software Incorporated, such as charges related to stock-based compensation expenses, amortization of acquired intangible assets, amortization of debt discount and issuance costs, gain or loss on conversion of convertible senior notes, the adjustment attributable to non-controlling interests, and related tax effects, including non-recurring income tax adjustments, cannot be reasonably calculated or predicted at this time. In addition, the effect of the anti-dilutive impact of the capped call transactions entered into in connection with the company's offerings of convertible notes in 2018, 2019 and 2020, respectively, cannot be reasonably calculated or predicted at this time. The effect of these items may be significant.

Cool-Statement-6959,"Just last month, Guillermo Lasso, the president of Ecuador, issued Decree 151 which focuses on a new mining policy, strengthening the government’s support towards mining as a key driver of the economy.

According to this [article](https://www.miningweekly.com/article/canadian-miners-welcome-decree-in-ecuador-2021-08-09), “The decree lays out a clear action plan and timeframe that has a primary objective of developing an efficient, environmentally and socially responsible mining industry in Ecuador, to promote national and foreign investment and to implement the best practices for the exploitation of these resources.”

To be honest, I am not surprised by this knowing how supportive the president is when it comes to bringing in more investors to the country. He has his background since he was a former banker and knows how important it is to bring in investors to improve the economy.

Because of this new decree, the activities of mining companies will improve even more. Just recently, Solaris Resources’ ([SLSSF](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/SLSSF/community/)) Warintza project produced some results, with the initial hole at East was drilled to a total depth of 1,213m with assays reported for the first 320m of core returning 0.46% of CuEq from the surface, including 54 meters of 0.70% CuEq. This is only the beginning though since the company plans to focus on resource expansion. They have been performing really well lately, despite that recent dip a few weeks back.

SolGold ([SOLG.L](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/solg.l/)), another mining company whose mines are located in Ecuador, also released its regional exploration update. Their Hole 1 at Varela is testing underneath outcropping porphyry-style vein stockworks which returned encouraging surface rock-saw channel sample results of 99m @ 0.34% CuEq including 25.1m @ 0.58% CuEq. 

But along with the decree is the promise of responsible mining and the inclusivity of the local community. Hopefully, these mining companies will stay true to their own projects of involving the local communities in these mines and making sure that there will be no over-exploitation of mineral resources. After all, the mining industry will definitely affect Ecuador’s economy in a positive way, the same way it helped its neighboring countries in South America.",1,The new mining policy in Ecuador and how will it affect the country

Here is the meat and potatoes of the law:

&gt;*Art. 1.* The purpose of this law is to regulate bitcoin as unrestricted legal tender with liberating power, unlimited in any transaction, and to any title that public or private natural or legal persons require carrying out.  
&gt;  
&gt;What is mentioned in the previous paragraph does not hinder the application of the Monetary Integration law.  
&gt;  
&gt;*Art. 2.* The exchange rate between bitcoin and the United States dollar, subsequently USD, will be freely established by the market.  
&gt;  
&gt;*Art. 3.* Prices may be expressed in bitcoin.  
&gt;  
&gt;*Art. 4.* Tax contributions can be paid in bitcoin.  
&gt;  
&gt;*Art. 5.* Exchanges in bitcoin will not be subject to capital gains tax, just like any legal tender.  
&gt;  
&gt;*Art. 6.* For accounting purposes, the USD will be used as the reference currency.  
&gt;  
&gt;***Art. 7.*** **Every economic agent must accept bitcoin as payment when offered to him by whoever acquires a good or service.**  
&gt;  
&gt;*Art. 8.* Without prejudice to the actions of the private sector, the State shall provide alternatives that allow the user to carry out transactions in bitcoin and have automatic and instant convertibility from bitcoin to USD if they wish. Furthermore, the State will promote the necessary training and mechanisms so that the population can access bitcoin transactions.

This isn't just making Bitcoin legal tender as some publicity stunt/gimmick, it's full on requiring that ""every economic agent must accept Bitcoin as payment"" as mentioned in Article #7.

Octoberandseptember,"As COVID-19 wreaked havoc across the globe, putting countless businesses on the brink of collapse, it has also given birth to new business opportunities oriented to remote working. In fact, the pandemic-driven “Work-From-Home” economy has led to a growing number of unicorns – startups with valuations above $1 billion. According to CB Insights, in the first half of 2021 alone, 203 unicorns have emerged worldwide. 

As the total number of these unicorns has tipped to above 700 around the world, Taiwan is mooted to be one of those locations with a high potential to pump out world-class unicorns. Speaking at Connect 2021 (Link in Chinese), a leading Taiwanese tech forum co-organized by TechTaiwan, Google Taiwan’s former director Dr. Lee-Feng Chien offered his insight on Taiwan’s startup and investment environment, outlining the challenges faced by Taiwanese startups and the country’s significance to the global investment community. 

“Taiwan’s capital market has started paying attention to digital economy.”

At the moment, Taiwan already has three unicorns. The most prominent among them is Gogoro, a leading e-bike manufacturer that has been expanding its presence in the US, Europe and India. Another unicorn is 91APP, a software company that facilitates small merchants to launch e-commerce apps. The third unicorn, Appier, is an AI software company founded in 2012, counting among its investors SoftBank Group and Temasek Holding, and has recently gone public on the Tokyo Stock Exchange, raising  US$130 million. In fact, Appier is the first Taiwanese company to be listed in Japan since 1998.

“The success of 91APP signifies that Taiwan’s capital market has started paying attention to digital economy, willing to give it a higher valuation,” observed Chien who, in his time as Google Taiwan’s director, oversaw its foundation from scratch, and eventually made it Google’s largest hardware R&amp;D hub outside of the US. By introducing three data centers, Google also laid the foundation of Taiwan’s data economy. 

“Appier’s listing means that Taiwanese startups have the capability to make it abroad,” Chien commented, expressing his optimism toward Taiwanese startup scene’s recent developments. According to the Google veteran, if more startups can expand beyond Taiwan as Appier has done before, it will be a boost to Taiwan’s digital economy. Constrained by the size of real economy though, startups in the digital economy sector have so far accounted little in Taiwan’s GDP. 

The rise of super-unicorn startups

The wave of digital transformation ushered in by the pandemic, however, is regarded by Chien as the opportunity of the decade for Taiwanese startups. He noted that COVID-19 altered the traditionally conservative investment strategy of private equity funds. As investment returns dropped, private equity funds have increasingly moved into venture capital investments. 

This latest development is simultaneously a challenge and a chance to Taiwan’s startup landscape: while it pushes unicorn startups to the forefront of post-pandemic global economic revival by funnelling in the surplus in the capital market, creating so-called “super-unicorns” valued above US$10 billion in the process, it also diverts investments away from early-stage startups. 

“It is the best time to fundraise for startups, but not necessarily for launching them,” Chien observed. Under these circumstances, he pointed out that in addition to the home market, Taiwanese startups would have to secure at least one overseas market , just like Appier did, to attract the global capital market. The internet-based digital world, he observed, could lower the threshold with its borderless nature, and Chien considered it a must for Taiwanese unicorns to engage with this platform to expand its horizon. 

However, Chien also set his sight beyond digital economy, considering its growth peak to be over and competition already too fierce. Instead, he identified space, especially the satellite industry, to be the likelier sectors from which the next unicorns will emerge.",1,After Covid-19: Former Google Taiwan Director Foresees Super-Unicorn Startups

GadnukBreakerOfWrlds,"**This might be good news after the rout in China tech since Feb 2021. There was a lot of uncertainty whether China is shutting itself off from foreign capital and how it could lead to delisting of ADRs like BABA, BIDU, JD, PDD, NIO, etc. But I guess they won't be turning their heads away from foreign investors anytime soon.**

BEIJING, Sept 6 (Reuters) - China will further open its capital markets to foreign investors, the country's top securities regulator said on Monday, adding that it will pursue pragmatic cross-border cooperation to regulate overseas-listed Chinese companies.

Global investors have been spooked in recent months by a flurry of Chinese regulations targeting sectors ranging from technology to private tutoring. U.S. plans to kick non-compliant Chinese firms off American exchanges has fuelled concern.

""Opening-up and cooperation is the inevitable trend in the integrated development of global capital markets,"" China Securities Regulatory Commission (CSRC) Chairman Yi Huiman told a conference organised by the World Federation of Exchanges.

China is studying further measures, including expanding the scope of the stock connect scheme linking China and Hong Kong and improving the Shanghai-London Stock Connect program, Yi said in a speech posted on CSRC's website.

Meanwhile, CSRC will conduct ""pragmatic"" cooperation in areas such as supervision of overseas-listed Chinese companies, cross-border auditing and law enforcement, he added.

Yi said that given interwoven global markets, governments should abandon the mentality of a ""zero-sum game"", as companies and investors share both the boom and the doom.

Global financial centres should facilitate cross-border financing, ""rather than become the platforms and tools governments use to sanction other countries"", Yi said, without mentioning the United States.

Yi's speech came a day after CSRC vice chairman Fang Xinghai made similar pledges to further deregulate China's markets.

China will expand the channels for foreign capital to invest in Chinese securities and futures markets, and will further facilitate the issuance of yuan-denominated ""Panda bonds"" by foreign institutions, Fang told a separate conference on Sunday.

China will also improve domestic listing rules for overseas entities, as well as regulations on overseas listings of Chinese companies, Fang said in a speech also posted on CSRC's website.

Fang also vowed to safeguard Hong Kong's status as a global financial centre, saying that Beijing supports domestic companies listing in Hong Kong.

Spinkis,"Neonode a 54m$ Mcap owns 50% of a court case against APPLE and SAMSUNG with infringment on roughly 4 000 000 000 products. 
1 dollar/unit would give #NEON 173$ per share - closed yesterday @ 5,17

How is this possible and what are the odds? 

Neonode owns the patent to the swipe technology and launched the first touchscreen phone in 2002.

The phone had small success at the time and the company changed focus.

In the great patent war between #AAPL and #SMSN 2016 Samsung overturned a huge verdict based on patent invalidity.

From the ruling: Samsung presented two prior art references, the NeoNode N1 Quickstart Guide (“Neonode”) from 2004 and a video and paper by Plaisant that were presented at a computer-human-interactivity conference in 1992. “We reverse the judgment of infringement and no invalidity because the asserted claim of the ’721 patent would have been obvious in light of Neonode and Plaisant.

New management in Neonode contacted IP specialists Aequitas in 2019 to se if they had a case against Apple and Samsung. In 2020 they filed suit for IP Infringment on patent 993 and 879

Samsung and Apple joined suit and challanged the patent in sept 2020 in IPR - this process will either nullify the patent or give the Neonode side a huge win.

They used the same tacticts as samsung aginst apple - Prior art in other patents.

The IPR Board agreed on one patent 993 - the Patent is up for discussion. 879 stands! To be made unvalid on grounds of earlier patents A/S argues:
Combination of Hisatomi / Ren or Hansen / Gillespie

Hisatomi 2002-02-20
Ren 2000/09
Hansen 1998-10-13
GIllespi 2002-04-17

Neonode have invention date 2002-12-19.It turns out have Neon had an ace up their sleeve.

Yesterday Neonode filed for discovery in Sweden and questioning of the inventor Magnus Goertz.

They searched for the originals of 3 documents already in their posseion all proving the invention took place around May 2001. This kills Apple/Samsungs prior art argument and makes the Patent stand on merit.

And for the trial and Jury in texas they want another document:
The signed licensdeal with samsung from 2005 that samsung never paid.All documentation from discussion about licensing with APPLE from 2005-2010
These documents will prove the value of the technology in 2005 - probably higher then 1 $ per unit?

They will also prove without doubt that Apple and Samsung knew about the infringment

IF IPR stands their will be a Jury trial in Texas for Judge Allan albright or settlement

How do you think a Jury would react to the licensing deal?

Or samsungs defence against apple that the patent is owned på Neonode and NOT paying them a cent?

The optics of this case is spectacular and the risk reward extreme.Neonode is a company now producing touchless touch for elevators and kiosks. It is just ramping up after corona and probably will turn from loss to profit in 2022. The client list include NEC and Schindler.

thatguy-lmao,"
I have recently been interested in Morningstar’s ETF rating system which has been a popular tool used for ranking ETFs and i wanted to do an experiment or judging of sorts on this system because picking the correct ETF for long term investing and sustainability is extremely important especially with compounded growth, dividend reinvestment, and the fact that most people can not the spend the time I did and usually can just spend a little time looking at articles or have to listen to financial advisors for ETF recommendation which may not always be the best idea considering not all of your financial advisors incentives are/will be aligned with yours. I have personal experience with this considering my father who has cash that needs to be invested in his 401k and also my grandparents which are aiming for sustainability in their portfolio allowing for them not to worry too much about their withdrawal percentage each year.


To start it off, You are able to check on Morningstar to see all of their 5 star ratings on ETFs which have varying risk return ratios

I have done the arduous task of narrowing down and categorizing these ETFs in their sector both identified by Morningstar and by different preferences.

In my first wave of narrowing, I searched up each ETF and looked at the 5 year price history, other analyst rating available besides Morningstar, dividend yields (relative to expectation and ETF type), Morningstar risk/return ratings, and long term sector/industry outlook for the respective ETFs.

From the about 140 5-star ETFs rated by Morningstar, only 91 remain from the previous criteria mentioned.

I then categorized the remaining 91 ETFs into their categories for comparison between sector ETFs to find which are the best picks:

	From this categorization we can see that the out of my narrowed down 91 ETFs from the original 140ish, it is a very well diversified portfolio of ETFs and represent many sectors in the global economy except for the energy sector which, besides new and renewable energy industries, isn’t poised for growth in the long term.

I may do a second part to this where analyze each ETF in each industry or in each ETF type more thoroughly especially for the categories labeled “(broad)” and may give my own rating on ETFs I find interesting since some of the large cap, dividend, NASDAQ, and S&amp;P are doing strategies such as futures contracts or covered calls which differ from the standard equity etf found in these sectors.

After this second part I will or someone would If they like to create a final comparison between the final narrowed down portfolio and the benchmark category I created.

BigBootyBear,"Investors in tech startups tend to prefer in companies with a hope of an exit or an IPO. And when that happens, the investor can hope to sell of his stock.

But what about non-tech angel investors, like those in the Shark Tank? A business for selling salsa online or a franchise for sushi restaurants are not likely to have an exit or an IPO. So how do the investors ever get their money back? I can understand the equity may appreciate as the business grows, but how and and when will it ever materialize into cash?

Do they at some point start collecting a share of the profits per their equity stake? Cause most of these business are very reluctant to take money out of the business since they want to reinvest and grow.",1,How do angel investors in non-tech companies (like Shark Tank) get a return on their investment?
adamsmith93,"Hey guys, apologies if this question has been asked a million times already.

I've received about 5k CAD in student loans that has to last me until January of 2022, or longer if I don't end up needing to spend it.

I want to put it into something relatively safe. Originally I thought I'd just keep it as 'cash' in an account, but I know that's basically a cardinal sin. 

I'm looking for recommendations on what you would do if you had 5k that you wanted to safely and comfortably invest over the next 4+ months. My mind is going to something like VFV or similar, but I am open to any and all suggestions.

TLDR; how to find undervalued stocks by comparing the 11 sectors and small, medium and large market cap companies. 

First I have a yahoo finance chart that tracks the baseline s&amp;p 500 and then inside of that I create 11 more lines inside of that that track the different sectors. This lets you see if money is flowing from tech into the utility sector. 

That happened to me early this year. It helped me spot it before it came out in the news! I didn’t shift my money from my tech stocks to utilities because I wanted to hold. But I understood what was going on before most people and didn’t stress it. 

Also the article breaks down why comparing the s&amp;p small, medium and large caps will allow you to see that right now the large and mid cap s&amp;p aren’t undervalued. The s&amp;p 600 small cap is showing me that there may be an opportunity for solid gains.

So I’ve been digging through that and have found some solid companies that I e invested into recently and am looking for some solid gains. 

Let me know if there are any questions about the full article here and I’ll answer anything here as well. 

Good luck trading!",1,Habits for value investors. This is how I spot undervalued stocks.
Jumbo86,"I am 34 and married.  Combined we make $140k.  We have a 1 year old entering daycare and another kid on the way.  Daycare is $1000+ per kid, if you are unaware.  

We currently take $100/week out of our paycheck to invest in stocks.  Realistically, we won’t increase this for at least 5 years, with daycare costing what it does.  It’s possible we will have to reduce it.  

I have approximately $28k across about a dozen stocks at the moment.  All pay at least a 3% dividend and IMO have limited downside in the long term.  Dividends pay me about $1375 per year at this point.  

My thought process is, these dividend payments will keep money flowing into my brokerage account and allow me to keep reinforcing my existing positions and opening new ones without having to sell off any positions.  It’s nice knowing that even if I have to reduce contributions to the brokerage account from our paychecks, I will still be generating some money to invest further with.

thatasianguy42,"Hi all,

The company I work for was acquired by a private equity firm (PEF) - they went from a public company (shares was on the stock market) but they were all bought by the PEF.

Now a larger software based company (LSBC) has acquired them from the PEF - the LSBC isn't offering the staff shares as part of their benefits program as they own the entirety of the shares.

However, they are offering ""notes"" (and no, I don't know what that means) which I think might be a way to ""own"" shares whilst the company remains private, i.e. internally traded shares (?)

As you can tell, I have no idea what that means or how it works.

My question is, if the company grows massively and I own these so-called ""notes"" - what does that mean in terms of monetary value?

As sort of attempts to explain this would be appreciated.

Thanks

P.S. they gave us a bonus - might invest this or save to move out from parents place",1,"Company acquiring another one, offers ""notes"" instead of stock - how does that translate into the real world?"
pawelmwo,"Can anyone enlighten me on the voodoo that happens after the account rebalances from a stock purchase in a margin account? This is through Fidelity. Before the trade I had $32,000 margin buying power with about $11,000 non margin buying power on Friday. I made a purchase for about $8600 worth of stock X shares. Today my margin buying power is at a negative -$ 8,000 and non margin at a negative -$2,400. It’s clear that my cash buying power was used because I have $2,400 left to withdraw from the account. So why does the system spazz out even though I didn’t even use margin for the purchase and have over $20,000 equity in the account. I understand the stock is volatile but it doesn’t make sense to me especially since I used non-margin buying power for the trade. Thank you!",1,Margin stock purchases using non-margin buying power

actmathsucksballs,"Although everyone has sort've silently moved on, AMC is still trading steady at $45. (\~500% gain from last year) GameStop is sitting steady at $200. (\~2000% gain). Ethereum is growing rapidly and currently sitting at nearly $4000 (\~2000% gain). The most popular NFT (CryptoPunks) have grown from $4000 last year to roughly $400,000.  That is a roughly 10,000% gain. I think you get the point.

""Value"" stocks like Ford and GM have gone up about 50% in the same time, a fraction of the growth stocks. Similarly, these value plays dropped 40% during the coronavirus crash, roughly the same as all risky assets like Bitcoin, Ethereum, etc. 

Which poses the question :: why would anyone buy stocks, especially growth stocks?

Everything Buffett and others eschew has essentially been thrown at the window. Now while one may have been focused on value and long term growth, their returns will have been essentially rooted to their peers who invested in growth. (ironic to call an unproductive asset like crypto ""growth"" but you get the point). So in logical times, you could say ""these are in a bubble and history does not repeat itself to the future."" however, considering the past 5 years crypto is up tremendously with little dips and currently sits at a $900b mc (btc), it could also be another 5 years it goes to $2t before it goes back down. So ""the long run"" point is vague and meritless.

Investing has certainly changed from 100 years ago when Intelligent Investor was written, though obviously many of the principals still apply, how do you adapt?",1,2021 has been unprecedented and changed investing forever.. how do you adapt in 2022?
azure_420,"Hi, I'm quite new to trading in general and I'm still learning a lot of stuff as I go on. I had a more technical question, which I'm not completely sure this is the right place to ask, but I figured it's an interesting topic and it's still related to investments and trading, so it may be useful for other people as well.

This being said, my question is about the general market infrastructure, i.e. how do markets work not at an economical level, but on a technical level? Years ago, trading was done using literal pen and paper, nowadays everything is computerized and what I'm really interested in is how the whole system and infrastructure works.

For example, when I buy 1 stock of AAPL using my broker website, what is really going on underneath?  The system is matching my order against a sell order of 1 AAPL stock and making the exchange, right? But what happens if more people do the same thing at the same time? Is there a queue of orders? So is it possible that my order won't be executed if there are no sell orders because they were all already executed against an equal number of buy orders?

So, I hope you got the point of my question, as a TLDR I just want to learn a bit more about how modern online market infrastructures are designed, and would really appreciate if somebody has some resources that explain this topic more in detail. Thanks!",1,Question about technical markets infrastructure
Darth_Pervis,"The worst financial decision I ever made was getting 200k worth of variable annuities with Met Life

As Anthony Robbins says in his book Money master the game, variable annuities are invariably bad.

I held on to my annuities for 13 years so that they would get back to their ore subprime mortgage crash values.  I should have bailed out and cut my losses.  Met Life and the salesman stole 13 years of the future value of my money.

Variable annuities are extremely complex products where you pay through the nose in layered fees.  Snd when you analyze the numbers, it’s a raw deal",1,Watch out for Variable annuities

When do you suspect production of goods and services return to normal to meet demand? Do you expect a change in QE or increase in interest rates?

PmMeClassicMemes,"These accounts vary in restrictions depending on jurisdiction, but essentially the main commonalities are limited ability to position short (long puts only), and no direct access to margin. 

Off the top of my head :

1) Buying deep ITM calls (eg buy a SPY 250 call, it costs approx half of SPY and returns the same dollar change but a larger percentage)

Downsides : often high cost of leverage (like 5% premium to asset value), limited time horizon - if you bought march 2020 spy 250 calls for leverage a year prior you may have lost it all, while stock holders did not see any expiry

2) Buying levered instruments (3x daily etfs)

downsides : volatility drag, liable to blow up in a 2008 style crisis, expense ratio

3) Buying mutual funds or other funds that use leverage on your behalf (eg PSLDX) 

downsides : expense ratio, limited transparency for some, often illiquid and difficult to enter or exit on short time scales

4) Borrowing money (eg line of credit, refinance mortgage) to contribute to your tax advantaged account 

downsides : you can lose more than just your investments(bank can come for your assets), might be screwey with contribution limits to tax advantaged accounts

Are there any other methods i'm missing?  Thoughts on what the best way is? I feel like it's likely deep ITM options. Eg - SPY 150C for Dec 2023 costs ~$30k rn, gives you a notional position of 45k for a leverage ratio of 1.5x.",1,What are the best means of accessing leverage in tax advantaged accounts?

## Online Gambling Growth

It was a tough last couple of years for brick-and-mortar casinos. The American Gaming Association reports that all commercial and tribal casino properties in the U.S. closed during Covid lockdowns, with tiers 1 and 6 operating between 24% and 50% capacity upon returning to operations. 

However, with this reactivation and the technological advances of online betting, the gambling industry is back with a bang and has become one of the fastest-growing businesses on the planet.

According to Insider Monkey, the online gambling market has reached 1.6 billion people, reigniting an industry that has seen a dramatic transformation through new technology. 

Play Today says that at least 80% of Americans gambled in the past year, as users rushed to online casino directories like Canada Casinos to crash the website, looking for some blazing betting fun.

During the pandemic, the business not only grew in size but also witnessed some eye-catching movements in online gambling stocks, with companies like DraftKings Inc (NASDAQ:DKNG) soaring after its 2020 IPO.

Also, “MGM Resorts International (NYSE:MGM) launched its mobile betting app BetMGM in partnership with Roar Digital, LLC,” Insider Monkey Reports.

## Stocks On The Rise

This year, 12 states in the U.S. will legalize sports betting spreading the impact to online gambling platforms. With this outlook, the famous site Gambling.com going public under the “GAMB” ticker, with a price per share estimate of 8$ –although down from $11 to $13.

The company controls more than 30 websites in 13 countries, and hit nearly $28 million in revenue in 2020 and $11.5 million in the first quarter this year.

Another attractive stock option within the online gambling market is Penn National Gaming Inc (NASDAQ: PENN), which was mentioned in the second quarter investor letter of Baron Funds.

The letter said: “Following a 232% gain in 2020, the shares of Penn National Gaming, Inc. declined 29% in the most recent quarter and are down 13% year-to-date. At its recent price of only $73 (down from a peak price of $136 in March), we believe Penn’s shares are now attractively valued.”

The casino firm is based in Pennsylvania boasting an $11.1 billion market capitalization. “PENN delivered a -17.98% return since the beginning of the year, while its 12-month returns are up by 32.73%. The stock closed at $70.84 per share on August 13, 2021.”

## Brick-And-Mortar

Amid the economic comeback, brick-and-mortar casinos are also on the way up. According to Truist analyst Barry Jonas gave Las Vegas Sands Corp. (NYSE:LVS) a Hold rating “and increased its price target from $43 to $38.”

The vaccine rollout is likely to exert a positive effect on these stocks, coupled with the company’s solid earnings and optimistic forecast.

Insider Monkey reports that “In the first quarter of 2021, Las Vegas Sands Corp. (NYSE:LVS) had an EPS of $0.68, short on estimates of $0.85. The company’s net revenue decreased 15.6% or $1.20 billion from the previous quarter.”

As for Caesars Entertainment Inc (NASDAQ:CZR), the casino leader saw a solid EPS of $2.03 in the first quarter, up from $1.80. Its revenue during the same period hit $1.7 billion, an increase of 259.2% versus the last year. “Caesars Entertainment, Inc. (NASDAQ:CZR) has gained 131% in the past 12 months and 27% year to date.”

thri54,"There's something funky going on in the Uranium market. On the 17th of August, Uranium prices started climbing, and they've been climbing every day since.  Interestingly, nothing of note around nuclear power has come out since then.  Just rising Uranium prices and analyst upgrades for mining companies.  Feel free to correct me if you know otherwise.

For some background, there's been a perpetual shortage of Uranium production in the world. The total stockpile of uranium has been falling for over a decade straight.  

Coincidentally, the [Sprott Physical Uranium trust launched an at the market equity program on the 17th](https://sprott.com/investor-relations/press-releases/sprott-physical-uranium-trust-launches-at-the-market-equity-program/).  When premiums to NAV get too high, they sell more shares, which they are then obligated to spend any raised capital on acquiring uranium.   

I think that there shelf program is, literally, moving the market.  Uranium is a relatively small and illiquid market.  [Total annual uranium production is in the neighborhood of 130MM pounds.](https://world-nuclear.org/information-library/facts-and-figures/uranium-production-figures.aspx)  Consumption is about 25% higher than that.  Sprott [lists](https://sprott.com/investment-strategies/physical-commodity-funds/uranium/) their uranium stockpile on a daily basis.  As of Thursday the 2nd, they had 21.8MM pounds of Uranium.  Checking the Wayback machine, they had 19.8MM on Wednesday the 25th.  That's an increase of 2 Million pounds in 8 days, or 250,000 lbs per day.  Daily global production is only ~375,000 lbs.  **Sprott's trust has bought 67% of global uranium production over the last week**.  Volumes are accelerating, and it's possible their buying rate will increase going forward.  

I think we could be witnessing the beginnings of a  reflexive process here.  Higher uranium prices will attract more speculators, pouring more capital into the speculative acquisition of uranium needed by utilities, further driving up prices.  

TLDR:  The Sprott Uranium Trust has bought 75% worth of the world's Uranium production over the last week, and judging by the volume, it's accelerating.

President Biden’s budget calls for higher taxes on companies, and it’s simply a matter of time before it becomes law, thanks to the Democrats’ slim voting majority in the Senate. Even West Virginia Sen. Joe Manchin, a Democratic moderate, appears to be on board, as long as the stimulus that the higher levies would help fund is paid for.

Don’t expect stocks to shrug off a tax increase. Bank of America strategist Ohsung Kwon estimates that a 25% corporate rate would cut 2022 earnings estimates by 5%, potentially erasing all of next year’s expected profit growth. The tech and health-care sectors, with a 7% decline, would take the biggest hit, while energy, real estate, and utilities, for the most part,would be unscathed.

For instance, the basket of stocks with little tax sensitivity includes Canadian National Railway (CNI), with no exposure to U.S. tax rates, while the more tax-sensitive basket includes CSX (CSX), a U.S.-based railroad company. In tech, the Netherlands-based NXP Semiconductors (NXPI) is paired with the more U.S. tax-sensitive Intel (INTC). Senyek sees McDonald’s (MCD) as less tax sensitive than Domino’s (DPZ), and Twitter (TWTR) as less so than Netflix (NFLX).

Other people are getting into the game, creating coins and institutions are operating exchanges, where they trade and where people can ""stake."" (where they lend their coins out - to be used in other trades) and earn interest. **Everything is unregulated.**

90% of the trade volume is done through derivatives and options with crypto as the underlying asset.  
These has lead to a lot of price manipulation.

On these exchanges, they use stable coins to make purchases where the price is supposedly pegged 1 USD per stable coin. One in particular, tether, is the most popular stable coin, operating out of the Cayman islands. - completely deregulated. There has been scandal after scandal surrounding this stable coin as it is known they are not pegged 1 USD per stable coin however most of the trade volume is done using tether token. **Tether has a 66.5billion USD market cap and like 14 employees on linkedin... they are responsible for the majority of trading volume in the cryptocurrency space.**  
This one stable coin, there are others with the same issue.

So, FED has got wind of this industry and they are worried about the effect of stable coins on the entire financial industry. Essentially, they have evidence that the stable coins might collapse and trigger runs (massive sell offs or people trying to withdraw their money when the exchanges don't have enough money to pay them out). The industry is now operating on debt (through loans (staking) and exchanges taking major commercial loans to operate) and they have derivatives with multipliers. And it is all unregulated. 

So when the FED tapers and we see a 10% - 20% correction later in the fall. People are saying that will trigger a massive sell off in the entire financial industry. AND because there is an excessive amount of short positions in the financial industry (they're not talking about crypto industry).  Some are saying that it will trigger a bigger correction that 20%. 

Also the federal reserve has introduced crypto legislation in the infrastructure bill designed to tax crypto industry more vehemently. Saying that people (stakers, exchangers and miners) will simply not have the information needed to comply. 

That legislation will be signed hopefully end of September or October 1stish. Crypto enthusiasts claim it will forced many exchange to have to de list and re list. Crypto enthusiasts also say the way the law is written is too vague and so many in the industry will not have the ability to

Jimbaliah,"I have been looking into it recently and I think he has a point. Index funds are extremely overvalued because they are too popular. People do not know what actual companies they own shares in, they just expect a crazy 7/8% return in a year. People will realize this, and eventually pull their money out, which could cause a chain reaction of stock prices dropping to the point where the whole economy could collapse. And if people do not realize, they still are subject to very unfortunate consequences if the stock market crashes from other bubbles like the tech bubble. With more people investing now than ever before, a crash could be 10x more brutal with nearly 50% of americans invested (20/30% of that being directly in index funds).

I also think the worst outcome we could see is the collapse of smaller businesses, since an index fund crash/pullout would hurt small businesses that receive a large part of their funding and have most company stock included in index funds. An index fund collapse could put a lot of small businesses out, but big business will survive and get even bigger.

After 15 years of banking, 10 of which with a very successful business account earning a few million a year, I was sent a letter stating my account would be closed in 30 days.  

No explanation.

Just a phone number......to an answering machine....that says nobody answers this line and to leave a message.

My branch seemed puzzled.  They called their superiors.  Everyone gave me the same number.  After 4 calls left, someone finally calls me back.  They say they don't have any additional information for me other than a standard ""you no longer fit into our risk assesment tolerance"".  

To add insult to injury, after I happily migrate my accounts to another institution, and add a business account for my new business, they then send the same letter, with the same number, stating my credit card is also going to be closed and I will need to continue to make payments.  They close the account, and my credit immediately goes down 25 points.

Mind you, I have not started laundering money, have not changed my spending habits, maintained a healthy balance, and am not late on any credit card payments....including through the pandemic.  

So beyond the horrific treatment and simply unprofessional disaster that is this banking institution, do I have any legal recourse here?

Sadly, it seems I'm a little late to the party because every company I've seen is ridiculously overvalued imo. I'm not usually a stickler for high valuations, but these guys are on another level. 

ZS has a P/S of 61.66, DDOG has 54.21 P/S, NET has a whopping P/S of 72, and CRWD has a whopping 53 P/S and 15 PEG.

thekidsells,"Pretty self explanatory. You may not believe things will go down, and if so it’s not my intention to argue — I’m familiar enough with investing to know value stocks will win if held in the long run and I understand we’re in the greatest bill run in history BUT I can’t help but see breaks in the dam. I’m looking to make money when things go down. 

Mostly concerned with:

1. Exorbitant P/E ratios fueled by aggressive buybacks — inflates stock price without adding any tangible assets to companies 
2. Powell had no room to lower rates, we’re at the bottom, when we go up it will massively affect business lending and many low-margin businesses won’t be able to stay around without massive price increases 
3. Inflation isn’t transitory. Now that money velocity is returning to pre-pandemic levels we are seeing inflation everywhere. It’s not just cars. Unless there’s more lockdowns you restrict spending, you can calculate CPI anyway you want and it will continue to climb 
4. The reverse repo market is super sketchy and more banks are participating

You may not agree with any of this and believe the bull market will continue forever, but I believe we’re back in the pickle faced by Carter and will need to boost interest rates to combat inflation at which point a great majority of small companies will fold — and largely inflated P/E ratios will fall resulting in a catastrophic loss of market cap on Wall Street.

If you think this is possible, or heck even if you don’t, humor me and let me know how you’d invest. I’ve got some shares of FAZ, SPXU, and UVIX because they seem to have blown up when interest rates racheted up in fall of 18 and I expect a similar performance when the fed realizes it can’t print its way out of the PE bubble it’s created.

MrIndira,"ESG Investing is a relatively new (compared to most other types) of investing strategy.  


Companies that have generated high ESG scores  (when analyzed right) have proven to outperform other companies in their sector **over the long term.** 

The high ESG is essentially a scoring that communicates a company's ability to be more sustainable, environmentally friendly and operate in a more work place friendly culture and so these companies tended to weather economic storms (so to speak) better than their counterparts. Again, over the long term.  


ESG analysis is thorough and when done right is not surface level.    
Therefore, these companies high in ESG Scores have statistically proven to outperform competitors in the long term. Therefore,  the financial incentive is that a high ESG score is associated with decreasing cost of capital.   


So we have ESG Funds popping up, and Asset management firms are hiring ESG Analysts - Governing bodies and other public entities as well etc. etc.

I have shared write-ups on this specific stock many times on other subreddits, My initial position was taken back in April, with many purchases since then.

Edited down from a **SeekingAlpha** article for brevity's sake. Full article is very detailed and a recommend to read fully.

**Short term Risks:**

HC Approval. In the short term, it’s all that matters effectively. This company has many opportunities not discussed here, so the long term view is quite bright. In other words, the face mask and PPE market opportunity is a launch pad for the even larger opportunities that will come later. Thus, if HC approval does not come through-

(more questions that delay things beyond, let’s say a month or 2, or worse, an outright rejection – neither of which is expected, but can't be known with regulators until it becomes public, which is why getting approval is a MAJOR de-risking event for the company)

\-then expect the stock to have a rough time of it. On the other hand, if they get approval... This company is in what Stan Druckenmiller has described as “Inning 1.” If for some reason, HC does not grant approval and bless it as anti-viral and biocidal, but leaves the door open, then the stock steps back and it will be Stan’s Inning 0, as long as HC ultimately grants approval.

**Investment Thesis:**

***ZEN Graphene Solutions Ltd.*** **(OTCPK:ZENYF) (ZEN.V)** has a major catalyst ahead of it with the decision of Health Canada as to the safety and efficacy of its game-changing biocidal, anti-viral and anti-microbial AgGO-2 mask coating.

Risks are in favor of approval, which would be a major de-risking event, causing a rapid and significant (roughly 100%+) re-rating of the stock. For those less inclined to await approval, the intermediate and longer term upside would remain significant, even from those levels, giving a pre-approval *risky* investment or a significantly less risky post-approval investment.

The business model is extraordinary (discussed below), so if the company executes anywhere near plan, this will be a hyper-growth company that will be a ""must own"" over the next few years as the Graphene industry develops.

**An IP Play on an Innovative Nano-Material, Not a Mining Company:**

ZEN was a mining company. It is now an IP nano materials play (“graphene-enhanced” technology). The company recently announced it is asking shareholders to approve a change to their industry status with the stock market and that it will seek to move to a bigger exchange, hopefully in the US. The company has a graphite deposit which is at the development stage, which costs very little to maintain for now and which won’t be mined for many years, if ever. I expect de minimis expenses for the deposit for the foreseeable future.

**Three Initial Target Markets:**

*Prevention, Detection and Treatment*

1. Personal Protective Equipment (""PPE,"" e.g., masks, gowns, caps, booties, nitrile gloves (hospitals and restaurants, etc.) and Air Filtration (e.g., HVAC filters),
2. Detection/Sensors (e.g., game-changing rapid, inexpensive and high accuracy COVID testing, with other tests behind that, such as STDs (a huge and rapidly growing problem), certain types of cancer and other diseases/viruses) and
3. Therapeutics - both topical and ingested, but that's longer term in nature due to regulatory hurdles and could be tremendous, but let’s leave that for another time. In addition, there are many other potential applications, such as fuel additives to improve efficiency, paints to reduce ice on plane wings, and countless other applications.

**Personal Protective Equipment (PPE):**

ZEN’s first market will be the application of its formula to surgical and other masks. The effect of their formula is innovative and game-changing: it is to be applied on an additional layer of mask, which essentially grabs the particle (the formula is hydrophilic) when it hits the mask (either coming at the wearer or from the wearer) and then render it harmless.

The next PPE application will be for nitrile gloves. Given the tremendous threat posed by MERSA, alone, it seems logical that the company’s customers ultimately also will apply ZEN’s formula to surgical caps, gowns and booties.

**Air Filtration, Air Conditioning Filters:**

This is an enormous market, with various industry reports reporting it in the many billions of dollars. That’s when things are “normal” (i.e., pre-COVID). If the mask market is a company-maker, the A/C filtration market is a barn burner. There are millions of office buildings in the US and Canada.

There are over 6,000 hospitals.

There are over 21,000 nursing homes and elder care facilities.

There are airports, airplanes, trains, subways, restaurants, theaters, malls - all are high traffic, often densely packed and require the best quality filters on the market.

And all are desperate for solutions to create a safe environment to bring back business.

**Detection and Sensors:**

The company’s product (separate from the AgO-2 solution) provides next generation rapid, saliva-based antigen detection. In about 8 minutes and at very low cost per test, according to the company, the product uses a patent-pending DNA aptamer that recognizes the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein simply through a saliva test.

Imagine going to an indoor concert today with 1000s of other people packed in in close proximity and no masks? What if for something like a $10 ticket surcharge, you could arrive at a pre-assigned time (let's say an extra 10-30 min early, depending on the size of the venue and number of entrances), get tested, have a highly accurate answer in 8 min, and then go in to the concert, free of concerns that the 100s of people anywhere near you and the 1000s in the auditorium have COVID.

Please see the company’s presentation for more details: [ZEN Graphene Solutions](https://www.zengraphene.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/2021_08ZEN-Investor-Presentation.pdf). The solution appears to be scalable, accurate (making PCR tests look awful) and has the added benefit that aptamers can be adapted to be used for many diseases, well beyond COVID. It's a tremendous market opportunity for the company that cracks this nut and also a very high margin business.

**Therapeutics:**

Down the road, the company is looking to enter the therapeutics market, including both topical and ingested applications. Management believes this market opportunity may be even larger than the aforementioned markets. As these take time to enter and will not drive revenue in the near-term, but also won’t cost much to pursue in the short term, I’ll address them at a later time.

**The Model:**

The company has initiated a pilot line and is producing roughly 1 million masks per day (1M mpd). The company is also building out a 25M mpd facility nearby their offices that is scheduled to begin ramping production in Nov. The same coating should be applied to many different use cases, so the company thinks about sales in “masks equivalent” (“me”). For instance, if a typical industrial air filter is 3m x 3m (my slightly educated guess), that would require roughly 100me.

**Margins:**

Assuming GM north of 80%, given that graphite (the underlying commodity) is cheap and plentiful, we’re talking about a nano-material, so very small quantities are required relative to output and revenue.

**OP's Note:** They are currently purchasing Graphene-oxide from a third-party to fullfill production, but anticipate a scaling-up of in-house production over the next year. Price of purchase is proprietary according to Exec. Dir. but claim that their studies of the material they are purchasing fit the bill for the mask-coatings.

**Expenses:**

Expect the company to be running at about $300K per month in opex, which already allows for running the new facility since most of it is automated machinery. Per [interview](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZiNxl9nMuZ4) Aug. 11th, opex was $200K/month, but given what the Chairman recently said on a public [investor](https://zoom.us/rec/play/o0pa1AWvr7JeqA8NB9eYv-msGZT6lyORYdfPNtQv0WsGV_xBAQeWx9kktlZAAW3_atTsk3TGZEAB3q1J.f6gqjOS0h0D6ZxTw?continueMode=true&amp;tk=BC-G9Hc3b6WfHM3UmFy3BtwyvR54zN_0CLWXDs2uJ94.DQMAAAAWnR6e9RZvMncxdTZNNVJwbVBlNDBFNUlkV1Z3AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA&amp;uuid=WN_Mt_sG54lRg2JoK-vzA8ctA&amp;_x_zm_rtaid=LzQDuI2dSS2ES6R-FeKTXQ.1629297669865.7b102740d4e41e5d6637da3088f7c22a&amp;_x_zm_rhtaid=39) call, they’re hiring at least a few heads.

For the sake of conservatism, assume that given the massive ramp in revenue and profitability, they’ll end up spending more than that, so double their current opex number to $400K.

**Capex:**

Assume capex will be around $5M-ish, a good bit of which already has been spent. Regardless, the number is so low as to be inconsequential if the company is generating the kind of cash flow, it will, given their current cash position of something just over $4M plus a bit more than that amount in warrants, many of which are in the money and some of which have acceleration clauses; roughly $8M-ish+, all in, vs a very low burn rate.

Obviously, since they’re only beginning to ramp and generate revenue, there is a wide range of profit possibilities. Based on what co has said: Assuming the company makes something toward 4c/mask, based on what would be a conservative assumption, which is using the lower end of the midpoint of the revenue per mask the company mentions in its presentation, which you can review, as noted, above.

Let’s say that at some point in 1H:2022 they’re selling out the 25M mpd. That’s:

25M mpd equivalent x .04 = $1M/day in revenue

x 80%+ GM = $800K/day GP (all numbers in Canadian Dollars)

x 30 days/mo = $24M/mo GP -$400K/mo opex (using low end of what management has said)

= $23.6M EBITDA per month x 12 months = $283.2M EBITDA / year -27% tax rate = $206.7M in Net Income /99M shares (fully diluted) = C$2.09 annualized run rate EPS (approx. $1.66 in USD)

(the company has a $30M NOL that will reduce this on first earnings)

**Balance Sheet:**

With $4M in cash and more than that in in-the-money warrants, some of which have accelerator clauses, the Company doesn’t need capital. Assuming they get HC approval, are generating meaningful rev and cash flow and want to improve the company’s public profile, I could definitely see this Street-savvy management team raising capital opportunistically.

I’m okay with that: a company that doesn’t need to raise money won’t be forced to do so at unattractive prices, like so many small cap companies. A company growing rapidly with their business accelerating and a long runway will have investors clamoring to get in at scale, so deal terms should be very attractive for all parties involved. Since they don’t need money, they can be opportunistic about whether and at what price they might consider a deal.

If they continue to hit milestones, any such deal would only be done at multiples of the current price. (Yes, I know that sounds like every other small cap dream, but if you dig into this one, you’ll see it’s quite rational.) Anticipate that the company will seek uplisting on the US markets later this year if Sep 27th shareholder vote passes through.

**Misc:**

Lock-up expiration behind us: There was a deal in the spring. The lock up expiration is now well behind us (early Aug).

**Insider Buying:**

The CEO recently bought 50,000 shares (over $100,000) in the open market. He's already the largest shareholder, owning about 4% of the company. I see this as a vote of confidence in ZEN's prospects of winning HC approval.

**Summary:**

* ZEN is an IP play with a strong management team and an outstanding business model and is creating game-changing “must have” products, rather than “nice to have” ones.
* ZEN makes an innovative, proprietary, patent pending silver graphene oxide (AgGO-2) formulation at the nano-scale that will be applied to various materials for many applications.
* Revenues should start very soon, incremental margins should be very attractive and the company should be profitable and CF+ imminently, *possibly* earning their market cap within a year.
* If things play out according to base case, the stock should trade at a minimum of C$40+ within 12-24 months, returning well over 10x.
* ZEN potentially has a very long and steep growth trajectory that could last a very long time. This is the best idea I've seen in years.",1,"Zen Graphene with 'Paradigm Changing Applications' in Healthcare, Green Energy, and Materials Science"
investing-scientist2,"Here is a couple of stocks that might be worth your attention this week. They were selected using a couple of criteria - most of them heavily rely an the company's fundamentals; the analysts recommendations are only provided as a kind of support for the hand-picked names. This is why I’m calling the approach a **consensus strategy.** 

The stocks I’m going to present you below are generally believed to outperform the stock market in the coming months, they have a consensus recommendation of Buy, their fundamentals are scored considerably better than most stocks and their average target price by stock analysts is above current market valuation.

In order to consider buying the stock’s shares, the following criteria need to be satisfied:

* **TheStreet score**: A+, A or A-
* **Zacks Rank**: 1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold)
* **Weiss Ratings recommendation**: A or B
* **Yahoo Finance recommendation**: at least mixed Buy/Hold
* **Yahoo Finance target price**: min. 5% higher than current price
* **Piotroski F-Score**: min. 4

#### Now, a few words on the criteria I’m using and sources of data.

**1. TheStreet score**

The first filtering step is to get stocks with Buy recommendation at TheStreet stock screener. I’m only keeping stocks with A+, A or A- rating (top ones), although A-, B+, B and B- are Buys as well.

From thestreet.com:

***A (Excellent)*** *– The stock has an excellent track record for maximizing performance while minimizing risk, thus delivering the best possible combination of total return on investment and reduced volatility. It has made the most of the recent economic environment to maximize risk-adjusted returns compared to other stocks. While past performance is just an indication — not a guarantee — we believe this fund is among the most likely to deliver superior performance relative to risk in the future as well.*

And about the methodology (source: https://www.thestreet.com/r/ratings/reports/detail/T.html):

*TheStreet Ratings’ stock model projects a stock’s total return potential over a 12-month period including both price appreciation and* ***dividends****. Our Buy, Hold or Sell ratings designate how we expect these stocks to perform against a general benchmark of the equities market and interest rates. While our model is quantitative, it utilizes both* ***subjective*** *and* ***objective*** *elements. For instance, subjective elements include expected equities market returns, future interest rates, implied industry outlook and forecasted company earnings. Objective elements include volatility of past operating revenues, financial strength, and company cash flows.*

**2. Zacks Rank**

It is required that the Zacks Rank is Hold, Buy or Strong Buy (so we’re avoiding stocks with Sell and Strong Sell recommendations). The Zacks Rating utilizes a completely different system, based on company earnings-related data, in particular earnings estimate revisions and earnings surprises, to predict profitability of holding the company’s shares. More from https://www.zacks.com/education/stock-education/zacks-rank-guide-6:

*A portfolio of Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stocks has beaten the market in 26 of the last 31 years with an average annual return of* ***+24.3%*** *a year; more than double that of the S&amp;P 500’s +10.6% .*

**3. Weiss Ratings recommendation**

We’re only keeping stocks with Buy (B) or Strong Buy (A) recommendation.

Wjat are these scores? This is what I found at their website:

*“A” Rating:* ***Excellent.*** *The company’s stock has an excellent track record for providing strong performance with lower-than-average risk, and it is trading at a price that represents good value relative to the company’s earnings prospects. While past performance is no guarantee of future results, our opinion is that this stock is among the most likely to deliver superior performance relative to risk in the future. Of course, even the best stocks can decline in a down market. But our “A” rating can generally be considered the equivalent of a “****Strong Buy****“.*

*“B” rating:* ***Good.*** *The company’s stock has a good track record for delivering a balance of performance and risk. While the risk-adjusted performance of any stock is subject to change, our opinion is that this stock is a good value, with good prospects for outperforming the market. Although even good investments can decline in a down market, our “B” rating is considered the equivalent of a “****Buy****“.*

**4.  Yahoo Finance  recommendation and target price**

It is required that the Yahoo Finance stock recommendation is at least mixed Buy/Hold from experts. Additionally, the predicted target price (average, from experts) should be at least 5% higher than the current one.

**5. Piotroski F-Score**

The Piotroski score is a number between 0-9 that reflects nine criteria used to determine the strength of a company’s financial situation, including profitability, leverage or operating efficiency. Zero is the worst value and nine is the best. As we can read in[ Piotroski’s paper](https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/9dc9/b030da18ab28d1e1a1bbf7e33fb5911f189e.pdf) from 2000:

*In addition, an investment strategy that buys expected winners and shorts expected losers generates a* ***23% annual return*** *between 1976 and 1996, and the strategy appears to be robust across time and to controls for alternative investment strategies.*

It is required that the score is 4 or higher. The values were retrieved from https://www.gurufocus.com.

**6. InvestorsObserver Overall Score**

The rank has a value in between 0 and 100. It takes into account both **technical** analysis and **fundamental** stock data. An Overall Rank of N means that a given company is rated above N% of stocks, therefore the higher the number, the better. My requirement is that the company has InvestorsObserver Overall score of at least 50.

*The Overall Score combines our two technical scores (Short Term and Long Term) with our Fundamental Score into one metric. This makes our overall score a great place to start when evaluating stocks, regardless of your investing style.*

*A low score doesn’t necessarily mean a stock is likely to go down, just that our system doesn’t think there’s much of a bullish case for it.*

Please note that the company profile data (short description) was taken from  tradingview (sometimes I shortened it) and dividend data was retrieved from MarketBeat.

&gt;Evergrande has warned it risks defaulting on its debt if it fails to raise cash, as China’s most heavily indebted property developer battles to stave off an unfolding liquidity crisis.  The unusually stark wording from the company came in an interim earnings statement on Tuesday that confirmed a profit warning issued last week and outlined a series of measures to shore up its finances that include selling properties.    
&gt;  
&gt;“The group has risks of defaults on borrowings and cases of litigation outside of its normal course of business,” Evergrande said, adding that it would pursue further asset sales, control costs and seek to attract new investors.  The warning comes as Evergrande experiences the worst upheaval in its history, with a stream of recent problems raising questions over its access to financing, forcing it to sell assets and earning it an unusual public rebuke from the government over its debt risks.... 

I'm sharing this because ***if*** this were to default, it could be a trigger for some much larger market turmoil. Evergrande represents potential systemic risk both in China as well as the global financial markets. IE, this defaulting ***could*** be a bit of a Lehman-esque type moment.

With that out of the way, I want to be very clear - **this is NOT likely to default** since the strong likelihood is that it will get a bailout due to the system wide risk attached to it for China. 

With that being said, history has a lot of examples of policy mistakes, or attempts to control asset bubbles that simply end up popping the bubble. I stated this a few months ago, but the current attempt from Chinese policymakers to control debt and reduce economic risk is a tightrope walk, and there are legitimate risks of overtightening. With that said, China has a LOT of control over all the levers in their financial system, so if any country would be able to stop a cascade, it's likely China.

If an investor with shares have a stop-loss order at 95$ and another one has it at 90$, which one would be executed earlier?

KingTimKap,"Chargepoint Holdings Inc. disclosed Wednesday that its car-charging stations had produced better sales than expected in the second quarter, and executives increased their sales target for the year, sending shares more than 13% higher in after-hours trading.

Chargepoint reported a second-quarter loss of $84.9 million, or 29 cents a share, after reporting a loss of $35.3 million a year ago. Sales increased to $56.1 million from $35 million a year prior, with more than $40 million credited to its networked charging systems.

Analysts on average expected a loss of 13 cents a share on sales of $49.1 million, according to FactSet. After closing with a 0.4% gain at $21.23, shares jumped to more than $23.50 in the extended session following Wednesday’s report.

With the sales beat, executives increased their annual guidance to sales of $225 million to $235 million, after previously stating a target of $195 million to $205 million. For the third quarter, the forecast calls for revenue of $60 million to $65 million.

3STmotivation,"Since I started posting on uranium last year, a lot has happened in the sector and we have seen equities increase multiples across the board. There have been plenty of catalysts that have spurred on this move, including reactor life extensions, COVID mine disruptions, new reactor buildouts, capital flows, shut down of supply and several more. A new catalyst has entered this market in recent weeks however and has had an immediate positive effect on the sector. This catalyst was Sprott taking over uranium participation corporation and converting it into the Sprott uranium trust. After everything was said and done, they implemented their USD $300 million ATM and went to work putting in a front curve bid for physical uranium (an oversimplification to be fair, but I want to keep this post short and to the point as to not stray too far off of the main point).

And putting in a bid they did, surprising perhaps even the most bullish expectations, as they went on to add approximately 2,7 million pounds of uranium in just 2 weeks and they are showing no signs of stopping at this point. To give you all some context, that 2,7 million pounds is roughly equivalent to the annual fuel needs of 6 standard 1GW reactors. There was already a firm supply/demand gap in place that formed that basis for this uranium bull thesis and Sprott will widen this gap even further in the months ahead. This will likely accelerate if they can acquire a NYSE listing in Q1 or Q2 of next year, opening the door to additional capital that wants to participate in this bull market via a liquid and well managed vehicle, causing the purchasing of additional pounds in the process.

This trust is an absolute game changer for the sector, as it provides the market with something it has not really seen in this magnitude before, with a consistent bidder in the uranium spot market that can really ramp up the price of physical uranium. Equities will follow this rise and there is no saying what this trust could achieve for the sector once it gets fully up and going. There is also still plenty of time for it to achieve that ramp up, as the price of uranium still needs to rise by roughly another 80% at least to incentivize enough new production for some form of breakeven across the market. However, that break even appears to not be enough to fix the current and upcoming supply/demand gap and an overshoot in price is looking more likely by the day given prevailing circumstances.

There are a lot of moving parts to this vehicle and I have been working hard to put the puzzle together and this post is merely a short summarized version of that work, but I can firmly say that this is the catalyst that has the potential to supercharge what was already a very compelling investment case. I will be watching the developments closely and the coming 2-4 years have never looked as bullish for this sector in my opinion. Should you have any questions regarding this development or uranium in general, please let me know below or via a message and I will be glad to help out. Thank you for reading, please always make sure to do your own due diligence as well and I hope you all have a good and healthy rest of your day.",1,The biggest catalyst in recent history is showing results for the uranium sector

I love love love cybersecurity stocks, think they are in an underdeveloped sector that has plenty of challenges that will be addressed by many of the stocks like CRWD, FTNT, PANW, etc in the future

I am most concerned out of any sector of stocks in the cybersecurity space when tapering begins or starts to become a real issue (in maybe 4-6 months?). To me, these stocks which are both tech and growth in a space that is still so under defined is going to suffer the most from taper more than tech names that have proven reliable for years and years, and bc the sector has easily done the best out of any ""growth"" stock in the past year or so.

First things first, if we want our money to stretch we have to think outside the box 
 Although I do believe in this company, I would like to help Microvast gain traction in the EV battery industry. In order for me to do that I need to make sure we’re all on the same page. Microvast does make me wet, but not wet enough. You know what would make me wet enough ? If we could dispose of the people spreading false information/ their worthless opinions. It is affecting the community as a whole and it’s rusting our tracks. 
THE INTRODUCTORY SOLUTION  
First we need to somehow contact Jimmy Neutron, I’ve been studying his work for years and he is extremely knowledgeable. Some of his in inventions include ‘but are not limited to’

And my personal favorite, Laser Sword

SOLUTION
Long story short, contact Mr.Neutron about the mass manufacturing of thicker electrodes (that preform well) with aqueous processing. As this will ultimately lower battery cost. A lower cost of battery’s will help enable widespread adoption of our company, which will lead to higher earnings, which will then lead to our stock increasing in value, which will lead to more money in our pockets.

The section titled ""Non-GAAP Financial Measures"" below contains a description of the non-GAAP financial measures, and reconciliations between GAAP and non-GAAP information are contained in the tables below.

Financial Outlook:

Okta's financial outlook for the third quarter and full year fiscal 2022 includes the expected contribution from the acquisition of Auth0, net of purchase accounting adjustments. The acquisition closed on May 3, 2021.

For the third quarter of fiscal 2022, the Company expects:

Total revenue of $325 million to $327 million, representing a growth rate of 50% year-over-year;

Non-GAAP operating loss of $35 million to $34 million; and

Non-GAAP net loss per share of $0.25 to $0.24, assuming weighted-average shares outstanding of approximately 153 million.

For the full year fiscal 2022, the Company now expects:

Total revenue of $1.243 billion to $1.250 billion, representing a growth rate of 49% to 50% year-over-year;

Non-GAAP operating loss of $119 million to $114 million; and

Non-GAAP net loss per share of $0.77 to $0.74, assuming weighted-average shares outstanding of approximately 147 million.

These statements are forward-looking and actual results may differ materially. Refer to the Forward-Looking Statements safe harbor below for information on the factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from these forward-looking statements.

Okta has not reconciled its expectations as to non-GAAP operating loss and non-GAAP net loss per share to their most directly comparable GAAP measures because certain items are out of Okta’s control or cannot be reasonably predicted. Accordingly, reconciliations for forward-looking non-GAAP operating loss and non-GAAP net loss per share are not available without unreasonable effort.

Conference Call Information:

Okta will host a live video webcast at 2:00 p.m. Pacific Time on September 1, 2021 to discuss the results and outlook. The news release with the financial results will be accessible from the Company’s website at investor.okta.com prior to the conference call. The live video webcast of the conference call will be accessible from the Okta investor relations website at investor.okta.com.

Supplemental Financial and Other Information:

Supplemental financial and other information can be accessed through the Company’s investor relations website at investor.okta.com.

Non-GAAP Financial Measures:

This press release and the accompanying tables contain the following non-GAAP financial measures: non-GAAP gross profit, non-GAAP gross margin, non-GAAP operating income (loss), non-GAAP operating margin, non-GAAP net income (loss), non-GAAP net margin, non-GAAP net income (loss) per share, basic and diluted, free cash flow, free cash flow margin, current calculated billings and calculated billings. Certain of these non-GAAP financial measures exclude stock-based compensation, non-cash charitable contributions, amortization of acquired intangibles, acquisition and integration-related expenses, amortization of debt discount and debt issuance costs and loss on early extinguishment and conversion of debt.

Okta believes that non-GAAP financial information, when taken collectively with GAAP financial measures, may be helpful to investors because it provides consistency and comparability with past financial performance and assists in comparisons with other companies, some of which use similar non-GAAP financial information to supplement their GAAP results. The non-GAAP financial information is presented for supplemental informational purposes only, and should not be considered a substitute for financial information presented in accordance with GAAP, and may be different from similarly-titled non-GAAP measures used by other companies.

The principal limitation of these non-GAAP financial measures is that they exclude significant expenses that are required by GAAP to be recorded in the Company’s financial statements. In addition, they are subject to inherent limitations as they reflect the exercise of judgment by the Company's management about which expenses are excluded or included in determining these non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation is provided below for each non-GAAP financial measure to the most directly comparable financial measure stated in accordance with GAAP.

Okta encourages investors to review the related GAAP financial measures and the reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to their most directly comparable GAAP financial measures, which it includes in press releases announcing quarterly financial results, including this press release, and not to rely on any single financial measure to evaluate the Company’s business.",1,Okta Announces Strong Second Quarter Results

Do you cash out at 10% or do you 'let it ride' if you have a few days to go? It would seem if I always cashed out winning options at 10% I probably would have more wins, but also potentially leave cash on the table.

Updated coverage: Did 22nd Century (XXII) Made a Good Choice Bringing the Hop Plant into Its Family of Plants to Modify

Will the FDA Give Traction to Their VLN Cigarettes Soon?

Good day everyone,

We are continuing coverage on 22nd Century Group, Inc. (NASDAQ: XXII), a leading plant-based, biotechnology company that is focused on tobacco harm reduction, very-low nicotine content tobacco, and hemp/cannabis research.

Current price $3.3/share (at 10:00 AM EDT)

After closing at $3.57/share in the Tuesday session, XXII shares began looking for a level of support in early trading today. I believe a support level at $3.30/share will bring buyers in and we will see increasing volume and price throughout the day.

Remember, tobacco is still the flagship product at XXII and generates their revenues. For the FDA, the decisions on Juul and other manufacturers could represent a milestone as it tries to execute an ambitious tobacco regulation agenda. The FDA in April said it was taking steps to ban menthol cigarettes. And it continues to work on a potential requirement that nicotine levels in cigarettes be set at minimally addictive levels, a possible game-changer that the White House would need to approve. It’s possible XXII may see a mandate and approval announced together.

The hop plant market is not as highly regulated as tobacco or hemp/cannabis, providing a faster path to commercialization. If you have followed XXII you know they have been waiting a while for the FDA to approve their ability to advertise their VLN cigarettes as a safer alternative to standard tobacco. We all know that cannabis remains classified as a schedule one drug by the US government.

Hop and hemp/cannabis plants have many similarities. Both are part of the Cannabaceae family of alkaloid flowering plants and the active ingredients found in both plants offer potential health benefits for managing anxiety, inducing calm, addressing sleeping disorders and resolving stomach problems, among other wellness applications.

The fact that hop, and cannabis plants are similar is important because XXII has already done a lot of R&amp;D, including that done by its cannabis partner companies, that may apply to hop plants creating new proprietary plants. Let’s remember that XXII has valuable plant modification IP and know-how including utilizing double haploids, gene-editing, molecular breeding, and other technology they have developed in tobacco and cannabis.

The hop plant has been grown and used to make beer for centuries (possibly millennia) without modification. XXII has picked a plant to be the third leg in in its plant modification tripod that is ready to be improved and expanded.

original report below

TL,DR - 22nd Century (XXII) Announces the Completion of Its Trifecta of Market Sectors with Tobacco, Cannabis, and Now Hops

Massive IP portfolio on the Tobacco and Cannabis Plants. **Now hops also?** I would say they have all major areas covered. (I will dive more into that later) no pun intended.

Good day everyone,

Coverage on **22nd Century Group, Inc. (NASDAQ: XXII),** a leading plant-based, biotechnology company that is focused on tobacco harm reduction, very-low nicotine content tobacco, and hemp/cannabis research.

Current price $3.57/share (at market close Aug. 31, 2021)

On August 16, 2021, XXII moved to the NASDAQ Exchange from the NYSE-American. The company participated in the closing bell ceremony on the same day. The company believes the move will increase their visibility and exposure to investors.

When I look at [the company stock chart](https://stockcharts.com/h-sc/ui?s=XXII), I see how XXII has come off recent dips this year. On April 26th, the shares peaked at $6.07, then dipped to $3.56 on May 13th. On July 1st the shares had climbed back to $4.63 before consolidating to today’s level. XXII shares have now crossed their 200 DMA of $3.34 and are **approaching their 50 DMA of $3.67/share in a bullish manner**.

I often note insider holdings as a value metric because the insiders have a vested interest in the company’s success. Insider ownership isn’t very high (under 3%) at XXII, but the institutional ownership (all data per YF) is at 36.4% of the outstanding shares. **Some of the big guns are holding XXII shares like Blackrock (5.99%) and Vanguard (4.68%). ETF Managers Group is holding 7.38% of the company’s shares.** Hedge funds prefer the companies they invest in to perform sooner rather than later.

When we last covered XXII in July, we talked about the company’s trifecta of core products, tobacco, cannabis, and an unknown third leg. I spent some time trying to figure out what that third product was going to be. Since XXII was already in the tobacco and cannabis sectors I thought the new market would be psilocybin. Boy was I wrong. While psilocybin is an exciting and developing market, it is still relatively small and in it’s infancy. XXII doesn’t chase small markets.

In a [letter to shareholders](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/22nd-century-group-enters-global-132000137.html) published Monday, August 30th, CEO James Mish said “I am proud to announce our third plant-based franchise – the global **specialty hops market**. Like our existing franchises, the hop plant market is ripe for disruption and offers opportunities for 22nd Century to provide unique and significant competitive advantages to commercial partners. The addition of hops, a critical input for the $500 billion global brewing industry as well as a growing source of medically-important molecules, expands our total addressable markets to an estimated $1.3 trillion.”

95% of all hops are used to make beer. The rising demand for microbrew and craft beers is driving the specialty hops market where distinctive flavors, aromas and nutritional uses are important in creating unique and differentiated products. The XXII R&amp;D program objectives include creating new proprietary hop plants and valuable IP using their know-how and technologies, utilizing double haploids, gene-editing, molecular breeding, and other non-GMO technology.

XXII is establishing a new subsidiary in the Netherlands, 22nd Century Group Europe B.V., to open new revenue opportunities in hops, as well as serve their tobacco and hemp/cannabis plant franchises through an expanded global footprint.

XXII is on the move now with a move toward globalization and a new product pipeline that may generate revenues quickly. The demand for proprietary, specialized, non-GMO hops is high and XXII has the tools to provide them.

7/23/2021 Cowen Initiated Coverage Outperform $5.00

**On the tobacco front**, earlier in August, the company announced that they were highly confident their MRTP (modified risk tobacco products) application has completed the FDA’s scientific review process and is now in the documentation process, the final stage before the FDA announces its decision. While the company’s VLN cigarettes were approved for sale in 2019, this important designation will allow 22nd Century to communicate key features of VLN® King and VLN® Menthol King, including the headline claim of “95% less nicotine.” VLN® tastes, smells, and smokes like a conventional cigarette. Both the FDA and the Biden administration have been looking for ways to curb illness, and consequently healthcare expenses, associated with cigarette smoking.

**On the cannabis front**, XXII has been building its network of partnerships to maximize the upstream segment of the cannabinoid value chain since 2019. Components of 22nd Century’s proprietary value chain include: plant profiling tailored to the needs of customers (CannaMetrix), genetics to deliver differentiated traits to maximize yield of a specific cannabinoid or deliver a certain taste or fragrance profile (KeyGene), and commercial-scale plant breeding and cultivation of disruptive plant lines as well as year-round ingredient extraction/purification (Extractas Bioscience, Sawatch Agriculture, Folium Botanical, Aurora Cannabis, Needle Rock Farms, and Panacea).

The XXII “trifecta” of market sectors it participates in is now complete with tobacco, cannabis, and hops. As CEO Mish pointed out above, these three sectors address an **estimated market of $1.3T**. Sometimes we get lost with those numbers but each **1% of a $1.3T market potential is $13B**.

Stay tuned for more of our coverage on 22nd Century Group coming very soon.

**Much more DD coming including FDA and mandated lower nicotine by the Biden administration**

In an SEC filing, Cathie Wood's shop outlines the fund, which looks to be at least 80% invested in stocks in its benchmark Transparency Index, published by Solactive.

xxx69harambe69xxx,"I wanted to post about how recent crypto market capital movements were fairly analogous to the flight from an inefficient capital market of China to an efficient capital market of the US

In particular, competitors amongst the various crypto technologies serve as a great example of how fickle capital and liquidity inflows and outflows are, and that generally speaking, capital will flow to where it can be put to the most efficient use in producing value for the world, because that generally reflects the highest returns.

However, because I used some no-no words that these mods can't possibly wrap their heads around, you all will not see this.

Why do they need to censor a market which clearly has staying power, yet they're fine with spacs? Why do they think they're entitled to censoring the defacto investing subreddit from an up and coming market?

crmckinn12,"What’s up everybody, looking for some advice and feedback on my situation. I’m 34, have 3 kids, wife doesn’t work, and I am fortunate enough to own a rental property with no mortgage.  I net about $1250/month after HOA, taxes, insurance etc. that doesn’t include unexpected expenses like fixing the AC or dishwasher etc. 

Currently, I really like the cash flow from the rental because it helps cover our own expenses like day care and mortgage on our house. 

But I’m wondering if it might be smarter to just sell the rental and put everything into SPY or something and hope to see it grow. 

If I were to sell the rental today I could probably get about $275k, and then subtract 6% realtor fees and also 20% of 50k in capital gains (bought for 225k about 4 years ago). So lets say I come out of it with 250k (if I did the math right). Would I be better off taking the 250k and putting into the market to let it cook for 20 years, occasionally pulling from it when I need it or is it better to keep the rental, invest some the income and then watch the equity on the house grow over time?

I would love to hear if anyone has similar experiences or is good at running a comparison model.

**Disclaimer:** **I'm simply condensing some thoughts I've had on payment for order flow (PFOF). I'm just a casual observer, and this is the internet. For all you know everything I'm about to say is complete BS.**

Payment for order flow =/= front running (which is already illegal). Nothing I have seen or experienced leads me to believe that PFOF screws over retail investors in any meaningful way.

Might you get better fills if you use a brokerage that doesn't participate in PFOF? Sure. Does it matter? No, at least not for the vast majority of retail investors. If you're in that *tiny* (probably non-existent) minority where your bottleneck to greater profits is fill quality, then you probably wouldn't consider yourself an investor, and probably aren't reading this post.

Think about it: If you bought AAPL a month ago, does it really matter that your order *technically* might not have filled at the best possible price? What if you only DCA into SPY? If you were gambling in penny stocks or options having no idea what you were doing, is PFOF the deciding factor of your P/L? No. Isn't it great that we can do all of these things without worrying about paying commissions? I think so.

Even if you *could* get better price improvement from a broker not participating in PFOF, you're still never going to do worse than the [NBBO](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/n/nbbo.asp).

It used to not be very clear to me *why* market makers are willing to pay so much for retail order flow. Then I read [this comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/algotrading/comments/hnkiaz/why_is_this_subreddit_so_popular/fxbzcx3?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3) and [this comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/algotrading/comments/hnkiaz/why_is_this_subreddit_so_popular/fxcfrlc?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3) from someone who implies they are a market maker, and the light bulb went on. Here are the highlights:

&gt;...  
we literally buy up your order flow and make pretty good money off of it because you guys genuinely have no clue what you're doing  
...  
in aggregate your orders are effectively random noise that we can trade against to make a small spread  
...  
If I'm market making, I'm putting a bid at price B, and an ask at price B + S for some S &gt; 0. I am hoping that someone will sell to me at price B and buy from me at price B + S, so that my profit on such a pair of transactions will be S, the spread.  
...  
So anyways one guy, Joe, has his fancy indicator X signal to buy stock XYZ and shortly thereafter another gal, Jane has her fancy indicator Y signal to sell stock XYZ. The ad-hoc nature of many of these ""indicators"" is that most of them will not be correlated with one another and in aggregate will mostly average out to some fraction of S.  
...  
So if I know that there's a group of unsophisticated traders on stock XYZ, I want to trade against them in aggregate compared to trading against a sophisticated trader who may actually know what they're doing.  
...  
The remaining risk in the above strategy is that XYZ can have actual legitimate signals such as news that causes the price to swing heavily in one direction or another, so usually when market making you find a basket of stocks that are delta neutral.

This makes the most sense out of anything I've ever read about PFOF.

If I'm a market maker and it's *literally my job* to be transacting in the market *all day every day*, and my goal is to make money from the bid/ask spread, I don't want to be exposed to any other source of P/L. The best I can hope for is to take opposing trades to as many orders as possible whose P/L will average out to 0. I'll make the spread times however many round trip trades that I've taken.

Now let's look at front running.

Here's what FINRA says about front running ([rule 5270](https://www.finra.org/rules-guidance/rulebooks/finra-rules/5270)):

&gt;No member or person associated with a member shall cause to be executed an order to buy or sell a security or a related financial instrument when such member or person associated with a member causing such order to be executed has material, non-public market information concerning an imminent block transaction in that security, a related financial instrument or a security underlying the related financial instrument prior to the time information concerning the block transaction has been made publicly available or has otherwise become stale or obsolete.

English translation ([source](https://www.sec.gov/rules/other/f4-433/mccann1.htm#:~:text=Front%2Drunning%20occurs%20when%20portfolio,same%20securities%20for%20their%20clients)):

&gt;Front-running occurs when portfolio managers buy securities in their personal accounts prior to buying the same securities for their clients, or when the managers sell securities out of their personal accounts prior to selling the same securities for their clients.

If I want to make money by front running, I want to see a lot of large, one-sided orders, and get in on *the same side* as those orders before they're executed (remember a market maker will always take the *opposite* side). When they go through, and the market moves to that side, I'll make money.

It seems like a bad idea to try and front run retail flow, given its smaller average order size and uncorrelated nature. Retail flow probably won't be moving markets in most cases.

Obviously the GME/meme stock situation might be different, but maybe not. Here is an interesting point that was made in [a thread](https://www.nuclearphynance.com/Show%20Post.aspx?PostIDKey=200252&amp;PageIndex=2) on NuclearPhynance:

&gt;I can't speak for GME, but in similar conditions, you'd really be surprised just how non-toxic the order flow turns out to be. Especially on a short-term basis. A lot of the real flow winds up being near random and totally insensitive to the spread, unaware of its own impact, and uncorrelated with microstructure alpha. Obviously, that's all great for market makers.

I will leave you with a link to [an interesting post](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/mb1dx3/brokerages_list_by_payment_for_order_flow/) that outlines what brokers charge for PFOF.",1,Opinion: Retail traders should be glad payment for order flow exists

Zannierer,"From many beginners books recommended on this site (Bogleheads, Random walk down Wall Street, The Four Pillars of Investing), the argument for long-term index investing lies on the assumption that the market is efficient and the stock price characteristic is that of a random walk. What would happen then, if that wasn't the case anymore, as in many frontier markets? Does long-term investment in stock still makes sense? Is index ETF still a good choice when the extra TER in active funds eats up the larger return? Or it's better to find less volatile forms of investment?

The investors can also gain from price appreciation should the asset become more valuable or sell it for a profit.

In the case of crypto-collectibles, the crypto-collectible asset represents the asset that is owned by the company. This is a new type of asset that has not been seen before. In this case, the investor is buying ownership in the company and the asset represents a portion of that ownership.

Jac1596,"A while back I started investing for my retirement(25 now) outside of my 401k. I didn’t know which route to go so I opened an account with Acorns($1 fee membership, although I’ve never actually been charged for this) and with Ally Investment. I have roughly equal amounts and put in about $500 into each one every month. So far in 1.5 years the ROI has been almost equal with the slight edge to Ally.

My question is should I continue investing in both, merge one into the other, or put this money and the 1k/month into another fund? I’ve seen posts on something called the s&amp;p 500 and how it has a 10% return (almost seems too high to be real tbh) which would be almost double what either of my accounts get. So would it be smarter to invest for long term in this s&amp;p 500 and put all my effort into this because of the higher ROI?

Note- The results do not indicate if the companies drug was approved or denied. Only the move after the date.

TLDR:

The average 24hr change in a stock price after the announcement was: -2.8%

The average 1 week change in a stock price after the announcement was: -6.7%

\---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

For those that are not familiar with what a PDUFA date is (from Google):

The PDUFA date refers to **the date the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) are expected to deliver their decision whether or not a approve a companies New Drug Application (NDA) or Biologics License Application (BLA)**

Methodology: The PDUFA/PDUFA Priority review date was found then the stock price was pulled using GOOGLEFINANCE in sheets. From there a % change calculation was made on the 24hr price change and 1 week change. All biotech stocks that had a PDUFA/PDUFA Priority review date from 1/1/21 - 8/23/21 were analyzed and an average was taken. Any outliers are highlighted in either green or red.

BooBeef,"I’ve been investing for about 9 months now. Over the past few months I’ve been trying to learn how to make evaluations on my own to find companies I believe to be undervalued. My process has been to look at a company’s market cap. And to compare it to its annual revenue and growth. I also add the total assets of the company and compare that figure to market cap. To see if I believe the current share price is attractive. If the company’s market cap is close to the annual revenue + assets and the growth looks like it could push the company beyond its current market cap, I invest.

These are pretty easy stats to pull up and understand so I’m asking for advice from more seasoned investors on how I should evaluate a company and if my evaluation method even makes sense as I could be totally missing something as a few months ago I didn’t even know what market cap meant.

MidKnight148,"I saw an article on Yahoo Finance the other day about an analyst's call for Ethereum to hit $10,000 by the end of 2021, link below, and it reminded me a question I've had for a long time: how are price targets calculated for crypto currencies? As far as I'm concerned, 100% of the values of crypto currencies is speculation (as opposed to intrinsic value) and price changes just depend on social sentiment, so are crypto price targets just ""intuition,"" or is there anything more to it?

Conversely, when analysts calculate a price target for a stock, they have several tools at their disposal: there are relative valuation methods, dividend discount models, free cash flow models, residual income models, etc. And sure, each of those tools do require some guessing and assumptions, but analysts are tasked with doing enough business research that they can make the best educated guess they can under a certain confidence interval. And that's not to say that every analyst does their job well or honestly, but good analysts do try to make confident price target calls using the tools mentioned above.

*Fulgent has a growing* [*genetic testing business*](https://www.fool.com/investing/stock-market/market-sectors/healthcare/genomics-stocks/genetic-testing-stocks/)  *for pediatric diseases, which management expects to generate revenue of  $110 million in 2021, representing a 201% year-over-year increase.  That’s a growth story investors should be following.*

*The  potential for multi-cancer screening is mind boggling — in both  financial and human terms. Based on a single liquid biopsy (blood test),  multi-cancer screening can detect dozens of early-stage cancers before  they spread and become harder to treat.

### Methodology

For each stock from NASDAQ and NYSE scores are calculated for each of the following areas:

* Valuation
* Profitability
* Growth
* Health

The scores are calculated using the indicators shown in colored boxes  above. For instance, to assess stocks profitability, Return on Assets (**ROA**), Return on Equity (**ROE**) and **Net Margin**  are taken into account. The algorithm looks up the value of ROA in  every stock belonging to the same industry and compares it against the  analyzed stock, providing a final rank: if there are 20 stocks and 5 of  them have higher ROA, then the ROA-associated score is (20-5)/20 \* 100 =  75, meaning that the ROA is better than in 75% of stocks. We want ROA  to be higher than in the other companies; sometimes, however, we want to  be lower than in peers, as is the case with Price to Book ratio (**P/B**).  Then, the mean score across ROA, ROE and Net Margin is calculated.  Similar with Valuation, Growth and Health scores. The algorithm starts  with Valuation score, requiring it is at least 50/100. Then it proceeds  with Profitability, Growts and Healts scores, each time requiring the  score to be 50 or higher. Finally, for the remaining stocks the mean  value across all four areas of interest are calculated. Only highest  ranking stocks are the ones of interest and subjected to further manual  inspection.

yldf,"I'm looking for diversification of my portfolio to be somewhat resilient w.r.t. crashes. As usual, I'm writing a bit of a preface before coming to the point.

As probably most investors are, I'm currently mainly invested in stocks, mostly several ETFs. I'm planning to rebalance soon, so I'm re-thinking how exactly. I'm -- compared to most recommendations -- currently a bit heavy on US stocks because it went so well in the last years so the position is larger than it was. I'm a bit heavy on Europe, but that's kind of on principle since I'm located there and like to be a bit Europe-heavy, and I'm certainly too low on rest of the world and Emerging Markets. I have a little bit in Government Bonds and Corporate Bonds, but that's not too much.

Now, everyone will agree at some point there will be a crash. So do I, but as everybody who is honest to themselves I have no idea when. Could be tomorrow, could be some point in the next year, could be in a couple years, could be in 10 years. I simply don't know, I'm not a fortune teller. If I knew when a crash will happen things would be very easy: Sell everything, go short, and buy again after the crash.

But what I do know is that when there is a crash, it's good to have some money to buy. I could set aside some war chest in cash and just wait. But that money will be slowly eaten by inflation and certainly not increase in value.

If I were to invest some of the money in other asset classes other than stocks, ideally some which would not go down the same as stocks in a stock market crash, I could gain some value, and when the crash comes just rebalance the extra cash I have there to stocks after the crash for added benefit.

If you think about it, that's diversification across asset classes. I've read a bit on Google what people recommend there, and here's a breakdown of possibilities, and my opinion on them:

* Government bonds (US and the stable European ones). The good news is they are not so correlated to the stock market. In fact, for the 2007/2008 crash, they've done very well. For the 2020 crash, they fell rapidly as well, although not as much as the stock market. They give some interest, but it's certainly very limited. Seems a bit better than just holding the cash, but not much. Also, if I'm investing in US government bonds (which pay better interest than e.g. German bonds) I have the currency risk. I could hedge that, but that would cost a bit of the meagre profit...
* Commodities/precious metals. I don't get that one. I understand that some of them might go up in a crash. But they don't generate any interest by themselves, it's pure speculation. An ounce of gold is just the same ounce of gold in 10 years. Under a lot of assumptions I could say that it might be a hedge against inflation and thus better than holding cash. But it's nothing that will provide any returns beyond inflation by just passively investing.
* Real Estate (direct investment). It's a shitload of work, it's very risky since it's hard to diversify unless you have a lot of cash to invest there. I don't want that.
* Real Estate (through REITs or Real Estate stocks/ETFs). Much easier to realize, but questionable how much it helps with diversification. The Real Estate ETFs all went down pretty much the same as the stock market last year, and while not many of them existed, the 2007/2008 crash was caused by real estate, so I don't expect this to have been very resilient (but I'm looking into whether the problem here is that weighting by market-cap might be a bad idea here...). This might be an asset class a bit more robust than the overall market, but I am skeptical. On top of that, I'm shocked about the dividend rates here, I expected a lot of them to be much higher. Adding a bit of that is likely fine.
* Tune weighting of industries/regions based on their performance in the last years. With that, I mean thoughts like: US stock market went extremely well the last years, so if there should be a crash, it has the biggest possibility to fail -&gt; have less US. Consumer Staples and Energy did worse than the market the recent years -&gt; more of those, since they won't fall as much in a crash. Tech stocks went exceptionally well, so they have the most potential to fall -&gt; less of those. This will mitigate the risk (although I'm skeptical on the Energy part), I guess, but also limit growth for the current market situation.
* Cryptocurrencies. Surprisingly high correlation to the stock market if I look at the charts. They crashed last year. Also, they're pretty high right now and their intrinsic value is a bit questionable. I'm not completely against investing a small portion of my portfolio there, but I'm not overly convinced of this. If they had a clear negative correlation, it would show that they are regarded as an alternative when the traditional market fails. But I can't see that being the case right now.
* P2P lending. I'm skeptical. It's completely unregulated, so there's counterparty risk. It's hyped a lot by influencers, which rings alarm bells. And if I look at bondora, which seems to have shifted the focus to their ""Gain&amp;Grow"" product, that gives 6.75% per year, but has a 1% withdrawal fee and a 400 EUR maximum investment per month, this looks fishy. This industry also had trouble last year, with withdrawal restrictions and higher default rates, so its resilience in crashes is also questionable. It's its own asset class, but lack of transparency and regulation make me be very hesitant here.

Options-n-Hookers,"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/aug/30/china-cuts-amount-of-time-minors-can-spend-playing-video-games

Chinese regulators on Monday slashed the amount of time players under the age of 18 can spend on online games to an hour of gameplay on Fridays, weekends and holidays, in response to growing concern over gaming addiction, state media reported.

The rules, published by the National Press and Publication Administration, said users under the age of 18 would be able to play games only from 8pm to 9pm local time on those days, according to the Xinhua news agency.

Online gaming companies would be barred from providing gaming services to minors in any form outside those hours and would need to ensure they had put real name verification systems in place, said the regulator, which oversees the country’s video games market.

Previously, China limited the total length of time minors could access online games to three hours on holiday or 1.5 hours on other days.

The new rules come amid a broad crackdown by Beijing on China’s tech giants, such as Alibaba Group and Tencent Holdings, which has unnerved investors, hammering Chinese shares traded at home and abroad.

The National Press and Publication Administration also told Xinhua it would increase the frequency and intensity of inspections for online gaming companies to ensure they were putting in place time limits and anti-addiction systems.",1,"More crackdown by the CCP on video games, minors can only play 1 hr on Fridays, weekends and holidays.

natery5,"Here it is, I got lucky.  I took a few loans in different ways to daytrade:

- $20k
- $10k
- $6k from my girlfriend
- $4k from credit cards
- some savings from my regular job

The reason I took so many loans is that I was constantly making little money and losing. At one point, I decided to put together as much money as possible and went all in on GameStop after the first squeeze.

When GameStop hit $340 the second time, I sold it all literally 5 minutes before it dipped, and made $65k.

Since that moment, I've been trading with $50k+ and it's been really easy to make money, so I decided to quit my job. After quitting, I got my hand into $25k that they had to pay me as severance.

Bottom line: I extinguished my $10k loan, and I'm constantly re-financing my credit cards with credit card money (so no loss there). My girlfriend doesn't want her money back, so that's good.

My problem is, I'm still $27k in debt with the bank, and right now I'm trading with $65k. I figured that, considering taxes, I have to make $1500 monthly to break even. If I pay off the bank, that amount is reduced to $700.

However, if I pay off the bank, my trading power will be reduced to $35k, which is insufficient, in my experience, to make money just trading stocks. So what do I do? Keep trading until those $65k become, lets say, $100k, and then pay off the bank? Or just extinguish debt and go back to trade with under $50k?

Thanks!",1,Pay off loan and lose liquidity vs keep trading until the same amount is made?
JonDyna965,"A lot of mining sites of a chunk mining companies are located in various parts of the world. Mining activities can affect the environment and the communities in these mining sites, so I think mining companies should also prioritize projects that will promote responsible mining and inclusion of the local communities.

For instance, Newmont Corporation (NEM) has sustainability programs that involve environmental and social responsibility. The company has environmental standards that are designed to protect the environment and prevent or otherwise minimize, mitigate and remediate the impacts of their mining activities in the mining sites’ locations. They also involve the local communities, providing jobs and provisioning local goods and services, which makes them become an important player in catalyzing the economic development and social well-being of host governments and communities. They also have the [Global Center for Indigenous Community Relations](https://www.newmont.com/IndigenousCommunityRelations/default.aspx), whose role is to “to advocate for excellence in engagement with Indigenous Peoples, both within Newmont and across the industry.”

The company is very inclusive when it comes to the local miners in the community, and hired a lot of them, generating jobs for people. They also put a priority on using locally sourced products and services whenever practical, to benefit the regional economy. Also, the company has an environmental management project with the goal of minimizing the impact of mining on the environment. This is also more possible since the current president of Ecuador vowed to emphasize the enforcement of environmental protection rules and larger involvement from indigenous communities in deciding the future of mining projects.

Somehow, a lot of corporations feel less responsible for the damage they cause to the environment and to communities with their projects, so I think it should be the responsibility of these companies to change and be more inclusive and responsible. All these globalization and the current climate of economic rationalism is making these people less human and deprived of compassion and sense of responsibility.",1,Mining companies and engaging with communities and environmental advocacies

There certainly must be some risk, or pitfalls if you will, that I'm not aware of or fully appreciating. Of course there is always the risk of the borrowers not repaying what was lent to them in the first place. I would think this would be of paramount concern.

AnmarAaluse,"Hi Crypto Enthusiasts,

Today I'll be sharing my journey in aiming to create one of the worst tokens (memecoin) ever deployed, from the very start. This could be a beneficial adventure for those seeking to start a new project, or those looking to invest in cryptocurrencies, hope you enjoy it!

Just in the end of July, after ""memecoins"" and crypto in general is forming a buzz word for a while especially after some making huge profits, a team was chosen to make something different. As a head start, memecoins are cryptocurrencies that have might not have utilities but grow based on their visions and targets, proven to be massively profitable in vast case studies. Having said that, the team want to address an issue or solve a problem, carrying a mentality that if we want to put any effort in this, it must have a life-changing impact!

So the initial step is to look at how to write the smart contract, which was obvious at that point to be mainly forked and standard by vast of the existing legit memecoin projects. Such projects rely on the what so called ""tokenomics"" to attract investors, which is in essence a percentage payable as tax, which is then redistributed according to how much an investor is holding. For instance, the buyer will buy 100 coins, then get only 90, where the 10 will be redistributed to all the holders, which will be repaid to the buyer in the same manner. So, We noticed that this tokenomics is actually profitable to the devs, the marketing wallet, and the very top holders only. So we decided to make the taxes zero; getting out from the memecoin concept aren't we? - Well, we kept pushing forward.

So it was decided, no fees will result in no redistribution, so what's next? the most important aspect, which is the vision of the whole project. So what issue will we be addressing? How can we make the maximum impact within a market where trust is becoming an issue perhaps threatening its existence?

We had an idea to track vast crypto articles and groups to identify the most repetitive word, guess what was that? yes, Fear - Doubt - Uncertainty aka F. U. D.

So what would we do with this word? we continued to monitor and note the activities of tens of memecoin groups until we noticed that the use of the word is mainly accompanied by a ban. And this was the weirdest point ever. So if an investor is doubting, he/she will be banned. If an investor is crossing the boundaries by asking where is his/her money, they get banned. Weirdest thing we ever saw, and couldn't understand. I mean, isn't an investor the same as a customer contributing to the success of the project? isn't the investor rightful to ask for progress even if it hurts developer/owner/admin feelings?

From there the idea was born; with a bit of research, it was noticed that criticism could mainly be constructive, and by constructive we can link ""care"". In other words, those who care are being silenced and banned which could be negatively impacting crypto adoption.

From this ideology we adopted the concept that says: fudding isn't bad, it is actually good! and this was the starting point, deploying an honorable idea token, with zero tax, we named it the FUDcoin Official. We created the Telegram group, pages, etc. So what is next? the marketing.

How can we market a coin that represent negativity, and make it so easy for everyone to understand what we stand for? and there it was, so obvious, negative marketing. So the marketing strategy being adopted (for the first time ever in Crypto), is that this is the worst project ever (perhaps this could make it the best). And here we go, we have the ethos, the vision, the roadmap, the token, and the strategy, and guess what? it was huge! everyone liked it. Negative marketing is hereby tested for the first time in the same market the rely heavily on positivism.  

Finally, we needed to set a launching date. What would the best possible launching date be to represent fear, negativity, doubt, and uncertainty? We googled the worst day and saw that in every year, if the 13th day of a calendar month hits a Friday, this could be the worst, representing bad luck. Opening our calendar guess what, Aug 13th, a Friday, in few days! Isn't that a sign? We believe it was.

For here folks this is part one of two parts, stay tuned to the post launch story, the results, and the angry marketing girl.

ilinula,"Why is there so little talk about platinum as a place to store wealth? You hear people talking about gold and silver so much more.  Is it because it corelates closer with the economic cycles because it is used more for production while gold and silver are better hedges against stocks and market downturns? Or is it more so because the price has been cut in half over the past decade so no one is talking about it? Does anyone know how this compares to around 2010 when platinum was at $2000 per oz?

I am financial professional I have never traded outside of simple fidelity brokerage and 401k funds/etfs. I however am very interested in playing around with the historical stock market data set. I’m not taking about individual company fundamental research but rather factor research at the market level. I want to be able to see the entire data set of publicly traded stocks with all associated data, (multiples, std dev, beta, sharpe etc.. etc etc etc, as well as monthly returns. ) I want to be able to sort by this thing and then filter for the other thing.  See what happens if I take the the highest xyz multiple stocks and then filter for only ones who have x% earnings growth over the last Z years, and then sort the resulting pool by blah blah blah. And see who performed best in the list. To get more on the weeds, I want to run regressions of returns against various random factors thrust as an act of learning and exploration.  I know how to do regressions on excel but what I don’t know is how to find all the historical data that I want.  

I just want to be able to fully explore all the available data in an excel style worksheet, and use it to come up with hypothetical strategies, for fun, and maybe on the future for more. 

Then I would also like to backtest the strategies that I come up with.  

I am a CFA so I have the knowledge and expertise to work with and understand the data but I don’t know how to actually source the data.

On the growth side I have VTI, VT, &amp; SCHG. On the dividend side I have QYLD, SCHD, and DIVO. Both SCHD and DIVO are a mix of growth and dividends. So really the split is more like 65% growth and 35% high yield dividends with QYLD.

I know the consensus is to focus on growth until retirement but I want to have the dividends as supplemental income along the way, not just for retirement. I backtested this portfolio and it was able to track back to Jan 2017. The account balance doubled in 4.5yrs and I'm happy with that.

ChocolateTsar,"&gt;[Amazon](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/AMZN) is getting into the buy now, pay later space.  
&gt;  
&gt;The e-commerce giant is partnering with [Affirm](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/AFRM) for its first-ever installment payments option on the popular e-commerce site.  
&gt;  
&gt;Affirm’s buy now, pay later checkout option will be available to certain Amazon customers in the U.S. starting Friday with a broader rollout in the coming months, the companies said in a statement. The partnership will let Amazon customers split purchases of $50 or more into smaller, monthly installments.  
&gt;  
&gt;Affirm’s stock spiked as much as 48% after-hours Friday on the news, adding more than $8 billion to its market capitalization, later settling up around 33%. Amazon shares were unchanged.  
&gt;  
&gt;Friday’s partnership is the latest sign of the booming lending space as younger consumers move towards these alternative lines of credit. Earlier in August, Square jumped into the space with a $29 billion [deal](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/08/02/square-to-buy-australia-fintech-afterpay-amid-buy-now-pay-later-trend.html) to buy Australian fintech Afterpay.  
&gt;  
&gt;So-called installment loans have been around for decades, and were historically used for big-ticket purchases such as furniture. Online payment players and fintechs have been [competing ](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/09/10/pay-later-is-booming-with-a-wave-of-companies-launching-installments.html)to launch their own version of “pay later” products for online items in the low hundreds of dollars.  
&gt;  
&gt;Affirm is one of the best known installment payment options. It works with more than 12,000 merchants, including [Peloton](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/PTON) and [Walmart](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/WMT).  
&gt;  
&gt;[PayPal](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/PYPL), Klarna, [Mastercard](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/MA) and Fiserv, [American Express](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/AXP), [Citi](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/C) and [J.P.

&gt;  
&gt;Affirm said some of the Amazon customer loans will bear interest, but some will come with 0% APR.  
&gt;  
&gt;“By partnering with Amazon we’re bringing the transparency, predictability and affordability that Affirm provides today to the millions of people who shop on Amazon.com in the U.S.,” Eric Morse, Senior Vice President of Sales at Affirm, said in a statement. “Offering Affirm’s alternative to credit cards also delivers more of the payment choice and flexibility consumers on Amazon want.”

Looking at his company's fundamentals, there are some very attractive features financially, but the declining businesses owned by Biglari were my first red flag. Biglari started by buying Shake Shack, and now owns five businesses that in my opinion are all not great. He currently owned over 60 percent of Biglari holdings via his own personal shell company, Biglari capital corp, which coincidentally owns 50 million in Berkshire Hathaway. 

He holds annual meetings similar to how Berkshire does, but according to past attendees, the meetings usually involve shareholders berating him for ridiculously high compensation.   Unlike Buffett, Biglari did not start by being an investor, but instead sold a company he owned at the peak of the internet bubble. He also lives lavishly, with a huge house, expensive suits, and a wife who looks like a gold digger of gold diggers. What really made me look at him as a Buffett wannabe was the company website. Take a look at [Berkshire Hathaway](https://www.berkshirehathaway.com/) versus [Biglari](http://www.biglariholdings.com/).

battlerobot,"Rivian Automotive Inc., the maker of electric pickups backed by Amazon.com Inc., has filed for an initial public offering and is seeking a roughly $80 billion valuation, according to people familiar with the matter. 

The Irvine, California-based startup said in a statement Friday that it submitted its S-1 registration to the Securities and Exchange Commission, confirming an earlier report by Bloomberg News. The company would like to do an IPO around the Nov. 25 Thanksgiving holiday, said the people, who asked not to be identified because the filing was confidential. The timing will depend on approval from the SEC.

Should Rivian go public at an $80 billion market capitalization, it would be one of the biggest debuts on that basis this year.

zero_to_one_,"**#1 Progress and profits come from monopolies, not competition**

Capitalism is about accumulating wealth. But in a world of perfect competition, nobody actually makes any money; all economic profits are competed away. Competition should be avoided wherever possible. Rather it is worthwhile to think about how to run away from the fighting and build a monopoly business instead.

**#2 A company messed up at its foundation cannot be fixed**

It’s pretty much impossible to fix a bad company culture when you already have thousands of employees. Make sure you’re investing in a company that has had the right culture since day one.

**#3 Founders are built different**

Most traits are probably normally distributed. Most people are average. Founders are not. Founders’ traits seem to have an inverse normal distribution to them. Founders are at the extremes on both ends: they are extreme insiders and extreme outsiders, disagreeable and charismatic, infamous and famous.

**#4 Great companies have “secrets”**

Risk aversion and complacency discourage people from thinking about secrets. Existing conventions are much more comfortable. But secret truths can be incredibly valuable. The question of how many secrets exist in our world is roughly equivalent to how many startups people should start. From a business perspective, then, there are many great companies that are waiting to be started.

**#5 The last mover advantage**

You’ve probably heard about “first mover advantage”: if you’re the first entrant into a market, you can capture significant market share while competitors scramble to get started. That can work, but moving first is a tactic, not a goal. What really matters is generating cash flows in the future, so being the first mover doesn’t matter nearly as much as being the last mover!

**#6 Be a contrarian, but also right**

There is usually little value to be found where there is unanimity. Value tends to be hidden. The key question is: What important truth do very few people agree with you on? The business version of this is: What valuable company is nobody building? A certain degree of contrarianism is embedded in these questions. Wrestling with them can lead to important truths.

bruhmomentsdeepfried,"Salesforce recently beat earnings expectations and their Slack acquisition plus the Delta varient slowing return to offices means the work from home trend is becoming even more entrenched and common. Permanent workflows are forming around this trend.

A case can be made in favor of a large productivity increase from work @ home + by polling data workers enjoy it more (obviously).

All of this makes me believe Salesforce will receive a vastly quicker return on investment on Slack than the market assumes. On top of this, Salesforce is combining their other cloud tools (including Tableau, leading data analytics tool) into Slack.

Salesforce is trading at a lower valuation gap compared to it's competition, despite being better positioned in the wider long-term economy due to Slack.

Salesforce has unrecognized blue-chip potential over the long term, and is building an undervalued economic moat by building a cloud platform on top of Slack to leverage into the ""new normal"" of work-from-home.

cbus20122,"For the people out there who follow the macro environment, there is always a lot of discussion in past market bursts (such as 2008 or 2000) that there are or were fed policy mistakes that either caused or contributed to the meltdown.

This is relevant now because as we come into talks about tapering, there is a lot of chatter about a potential fed policy mistake one way or another. 

But I think this is a poor way to think about these items, and views of mistakes completely ignore the context of the macro environment and ***why*** the fed made the supposed mistakes in the first place. 

**Most Policy Mistakes Are Fed Decisions Where They're Forced To Choose Between Two Bad Choices**

# Fed Policy Quick History: Caught Between Tough Choices

Lets start with a quick history of important fed decisions, many which have been labeled policy errors in the past. 

* **1980-1982 Volcker Rate Shock:** This was the worst recession the USA had since the GFC, and capped off an era where Inflation was the boogeyman and there were multiple bad recessions and employment shocks. At this time, inflation was running extremely hot (over 10%), and it was starting to get out of control. 
   * **The Fed's Dilemma:** Raising interest rates would kill the economy, which was already having a tough time dealing with the inflation of the time. Rates would have to rise to 18%, which would seriously cut off lending growth. But it would effectively stem the tide of inflation. Volcker chose the very tough decision to raise rates to 18%, which effectively cut inflation down significantly.   
Another point worth making is that the introduction of Reagonomics was a key factor in reversing the age of inflation of the 1970's, where there was a significant lack of investment in new productive capacity.  At the time, this was extremely beneficial. OF course, we're more or less at the opposite end of that spectrum right now where we have a glut of overinvestment and have possibly taken the 80's policies too far (obviously subject to political debate and views).  
* **1998 LTCM Bailout:** This was a historic bailout that occurred during a time of a lot of international market turmoil (Asian financial crisis + Russian default) and a burgeoning US equity bubble (dotcom bubble was starting to really pick up steam here).  The sudden failure of LTCM however threatened systemic issues in the financial system, and thus became the first bailout of a private hedge fund by the FED. This was a new precedent, and many believe it kickstarted the parabolic phase of the dotcom bubble. 
   * **The Fed's Dilemma:** Do you allow the LTCM meltdown to spill into the rest of the US banking system and economy, or do you bail out LTCM and support the economy + job growth? The fed chose the latter, which at the time supported their mandate of stable prices and full employment. They did not have a crystal ball suggesting an even greater equity bubble would form from this. 
* **2000-2003 Dotcom Bubble Burst:** After likely contributing to the dotcom bubble with the LTCM bailout and interest rate decrease, inflation started to rise a bit in late 1999, and credit growth and equity mania forced the Fed's hand to cap the bubble before it became even more difficult to control. The fed did a few emergency rate hikes, and the credit cycle quickly turned down, which had been feeding the dotcom mania. 
   * **The Fed's Dilemma:** Critics of the fed would have said that the emergency rate hike burst the bubble. Critics of the fed also said that they let the bubble get out of hand. Literally, there was no good choice here except to bite the bullet and hope the landing wasn't too hard. In reality, the *real* economy did have a soft landing in the dotcom bubble, partially thanks to the fed's interest rate decrease after the bubble really started to get going. 
* **2007-2008 GFC:** After dropping interest rates to keep the economy afloat during the GFC, very few people wanted anything to do with equities, especially tech stocks. This caused a shift in behavior towards real estate, which was already quite strong and resilient even during the dotcom crash. At the same time, the global economy was recovering from the crises of the late 90's and dotcom era, the euro was being adopted as a currency, and China was rising as a member of the world trade organization. All of the above created a perfect storm for US real estate getting piled into via carry trades, while the US Dollar was getting depreciated by all the above factors. 
   * **The Fed's Dilemma:** The fed clearly started to see the monster that was being created in 2005. Not only was credit growth going parabolic + real estate lending going off the charts, but inflation was also surging in the USA due to all the aforementioned factors. Gas prices surged to over 4$ per gallon (at a time when many drove ""clunkers""), Copper surged to very high prices, and real estate / rent was also going parabolic. Greenspan was looking into a surge in inflation that hadn't been seen since the 70's, and was forced to decide between allowing real estate and inflation to go completely unchecked, or to raise rates very quickly to stem the flows from getting more and more out of hand.   
He chose the latter of raising rates, which then led to the chain reaction causing the GFC. Thing is, we don't know how much worse things may have gotten if Greenspan chose to ***not*** raise rates. Think of how much larger the US real estate bubble would have become if it wasn't cut off at the source. As bad as things got in 2008, they could have been worse if they allowed things to continue. 
* **Post GFC Environment:** After the GFC, the Fed shifted stance and most central banks became far more accomodative. The reaction of policymakers to any asset drawdowns has become far quicker and far larger. With that said, there have been some scares where the fed was tightening a little bit, which threatened to choke off the economy. The most noteworthy one was in late 2018, where the rate hikes and QE Rollback caused a 20% drop in markets before the fed reversed policy to engineer the 2019 rebound. This was likely a close call in some regards.   


# Lessons and Takeaways

From all the above, there are a few important lessons for investors when it comes to understanding equity and credit cycles + risk in the macro economy.   


1. **The party likely will or can continue so long as the central bank / government are accomodative:** You'll notice that all of the above recessions occurred during a time when the central banks were ***forced*** to tighten financial conditions.   

2. **Inflation (asset inflation or economic inflation) is always what takes the punch bowl away:** So what causes the fed or government to reverse accommodative policy? Almost always inflation. With a mandate to maintain stable prices and employment, inflation in the real economy tends to damage consumer's wallet and destabilizes prices. Inflation in assets typically comes with credit expansion, and threatens to destabilize employment and prices as it becomes larger and increasingly more fragile. These items generally tie the central banks' hands and force them into tough decisions. The ***levels*** at which the fed is forced to take away the punch bowl however is a lot more subject to opinion, and definitely not precise however.   

3. **Raising rates or tightening policy into an overleveraged environment creates systemic risk:** If you note the difference between the 1980's rate increase from Volcker, and the interest rate increases from the GFC or even in 2018, you'll notice how much more sensitive the economy is to rising rates. And furthermore, you'll likely realize how much more convex the downside gets with the more debt that exists in a system.   

4. **Debt in a system puts a soft cap on long term inflation rates:** Because central banks tend to get forced into action when inflation rears its head, and because the central bank behavior causes debt defaults and credit issues to arise, this forms something of a natural soft ceiling on how high both inflation as well as interest rates will go before triggering a deflationary shock. Once again, this isn't any set level, but you get a good broad view of this by looking at long term interest rates since the 80's, and then looking at aggregate leverage / credit.   

5. **The fed shifting to less accomodative stances isn't consistent with timing of market selloffs or recessions:** If you're trying to time the market based off this alone, you may get it right some times, but other times you would be far off. This timed the top of the dotcom bubble, but also missed out on the top of the GFC by over two years and quite a few rate hikes. It also missed out on most of the gains in 2017 and 2018 despite rising rates.   

6. **The fed doesn't make ""mistakes"", they make choices to deal with the problem at hand over the problems that may occur in the future:** In nearly every situation, the fed's dilemma caused them to choose between dealing with the problem that is currently occurring in the market with the risk that their solution could cause a problem somewhere else down the road. In every instance, the fed chooses to deal with the ***current*** problem over the problem that may be. And most people would not do anything different, because we don't have crystal balls and can't predict the future. I do think the fed has made bad choices, but most of the choices actually fit their **mandate**. In other words, don't hate the player, hate the game.",1,"Some Thoughts on Fed Policy and ""Policy Mistakes"" As We Start Talking About Tapering"

1. There is no legal precedent to disallow non-residents from opening an account in Canada
2. Any brokerage doing so would need to be licensed in the US (and likely, my state) as well as Canada

sixth-edition-value,"West Fraser timber is a Canadian lumber company that produces and processes wood products. They are traded on the TSX and the NYSE, and they are based in central British Columbia. They are the largest logging company in the world by market cap (11.71B) and by production capacity (6735 MMfbm). Canfor is a very close competitor with a capacity of 6700 MMfbm. 
Canfor has a very similar story. They are based in Vancouver, and despite their high production and production capacity, they are valued at more than ⅓ of WFG.
	The industry is closely tied to economic conditions, and lumber has recently been at record prices. Since then, lumber prices have come down to close to the decade average. The economic concerns here are not very important, but it will be important to consider that the high lumber prices may have artificially boosted operating results. 

A comparison of the two lumber companies (Dollar figures are all in CAD):

|Metric|WFG|Canfor|
:--|:--|:--|
|Market Cap|11.71B|3.34B|
|Revenue|5.850B|5.454B|
|Net Income|776M|559M|
|Lumber production (MMfbm)|5958|5204|
|Debt/Equity|0.2|0.25|
|ROE|24.6%|21%|
|Current Ratio|2.5|2.1|
|Total assets|5.32B|5.108B|
|Total Equity|3.155B|2.664B|



Comparatively, it is quite confusing why Canfor is worth so little. WFG has slightly more sales, net income, production, and balance sheet size. But does an eight percent difference in figures really warrant WFG to be worth almost four times as much as Canfor? They have slightly more efficient operations, and their balance sheet is slightly healthier, but when looking at some of the price ratios such as P/E and P/B, Canfor suddenly becomes more favorable. 
	Canfors’ balance sheet has grown significantly since 2014 from 2.48B to 5.1B, giving us a CAGR of 11%, which is partially attributable to an excessively favorable economic environment. WFGs balance sheet CAGR over the same period is 8%. Sales follow a similar trend. It is more clear now that the lesser's financial position is at the expense of greater growth. 	Constructing a conservative DCF may also provide some more insight. Here are the results I got from my calculations:
	
|Company|Price Range, 10Y DCF|Margin of safety|
:--|:--|:--|
|Canfor @21|$100-$120|79-82%|
|WFG @76|$200-$250|62-69%|



As you can see, the valuations are pretty crazy. I have not seen businesses that can generate cash like this in a long time. Both of them look incredibly attractive on this metric.

Powell is expected to make press on economic policy this Friday 08/27/21 
The much anticipated Jackson Hole symposium kicks off on Thursday, where central bankers will potentially provide updates on their plan around tapering monetary stimulus. The Federal Reserve has been purchasing at least $120 billion of bonds per month to curb longer-term interest rates and jumpstart economic growth as the pandemic wreaked havoc on the economy.

I've heard the saying that when economists say there will be a correction, it is the time to buy. And when the Government (the Fed) says the economy is in a good space, it is time to sell. 
This is just all from anecdotal and media. I might be wrong. 

Taper talk is the worry, but if inflation continues to run hot and economic data continues to be mixed the timing of tapering could get pushed,” noted Lindsey Bell, chief investment strategist at Ally Invest. “It’s unlikely that the Fed will force a taper on an economy that isn’t ready, and the outlook is becoming less certain with the rise of the Delta variant.”

Bell added that the deciding factor could be August’s jobs report due Sept. 3, given that Covid cases have jumped in the past month as the delta variant spreads.

Market_Madness,"#**Introduction**
The world of finance is absolutely filled with people making claims about what’s good or bad, how you should or shouldn’t do something, and what you can and can’t achieve. My goal is to take a look at these claims, spend some time researching them, and then share what I’ve found. I’m going to investigate various strategies, ratios, indicators, portfolios, and general market concepts with the goal of determining which ones are just noise and which ones might help you get ahead. 

Every method of valuation has its pros and cons. For example, the price to earnings ratio can only be used on profitable companies and the price to book ratio is quite terrible with companies that are heavy on intangible assets. I’ve already done write ups on these two ratios for anyone new to these. 

So, none of them are perfect, but one of them can come quite close – with a little bit of help. I’m going to explain what price to sales is, why it works, how to use it, and then I’m going to make a modification to increase its effectiveness.

#**What is P/S?**
The price to sales ratio is calculated by dividing the company’s total market cap by it’s total revenue. Why it’s called price to sales and not price to revenue, who knows, but revenue is simply the number of sales times the number of units sold so the name isn’t too far off. 

What is this ratio actually saying? It’s a way of normalizing the relationship between the market cap and the revenue. Let’s say a company’s market cap is $100 and that their revenue was $25. Dividing 100 by 25 results in a price to sales of four. This means that this company earns 1/4th of its total value each year. This number on its own doesn’t really mean anything, but it’s a way to compare companies to each other. Let’s say we have a second business that has a market cap of $300 and a revenue of $100 which results in a price to sales of three. When market caps and revenues are in the billions it can be hard to tell which one makes proportionally more money. When you normalize them like this you can see that the second company makes 1/3rd of its value each year vs the 1/4th from the first example. 

Knowing this, it makes sense to buy companies with lower price to earnings ratios because a lower ratios means you’re making proportionally more money for your size.

#**Real application**
Most fundamental ratios are aimed at finding good value stocks that may be underpriced, however not everyone is looking for traditional value stocks. Price to sales is one of the few ways to value growth stocks as well as stocks that are not yet profitable. These types of companies often have low or negative earnings. This is likely because they are either just starting to grow, or because they are reinvesting everything back into the company to attempt to grow faster. If you were using price to earnings these would appear to have incredibly high or non-existent ratios and would be quickly ignored by most people. Price to sales still very much applies to value stocks, I simply wanted to show that it’s not exclusive to them like many other ratios are.

So now you know how to calculate it and that it can be used on almost anything, but how do you actually use it. If you’ve read my other write ups or watched any of my videos you’ll become very familiar with this answer – you use it to compare similar companies in similar industries. The reason for this is because you want to minimize external factors that could shift the results one way or another. Price to sales is often considered to be a judge of popularity because some sectors will have higher ratios simply because they are more popular industries. Innovative new companies working on artificial intelligence or green energy will likely have higher ratios than tobacco or oil companies even if their financial statistics and growth expectations were the same. This is simply because people *like* those companies more.

#**The good and the bad of using sales**
Let’s dive into the positives of using sales or revenue as a metric. The revenue a company earns is a pretty straightforward number. There are fewer precursory steps to reach it than something like earnings or book value, both of which can be manipulated by different business and accounting practices. This means that it’s generally more reliable than anything that is derived later down the line. As I mentioned before, it can be applied to a wider array of companies because basically every company has a revenue. It also does not get influenced by the ratio of tangible or intangible assets like book value can. This makes it sound far superior to both anything that uses earnings or book value, but it does have some pitfalls. 

I had two example companies above, one company worth $100 and earning $25 and one company worth $300 and earning $100. We determined that the second one, which has a P/S of three, was better. What if the first company only had $10 in expenditures while the second company had $75? The $100 company would take home $15 in profit and the $300 company would only take home $25 despite being three times larger. When you multiply P/S by the profit margin you arrive back at P/E. The lesson here is that revenue doesn’t mean as much when you don’t know the profit margins. If you don’t want to be tricked by this, either compare companies that have similar profit margins, or make sure both P/S and P/E agree on which company is better. 

The next pitfall on our list is the issue of cash and debt. A company with more debt has more leverage. They can spend additional money which allows them to generate additional returns. A company with no debt might have $10 to spend which might yield $20 in revenue. A company with x2 leverage has $20 to spend which might yield $40 in revenue. This boosts their revenue but it’s because they were taking on more risk, not because they actually performed better. Thankfully this also has a pretty nice fix. Let’s make up yet another hypothetical company. Company C has a market cap of $500, a revenue of $100, this would give it a P/S of 5. It also has $25 in cash, and $125 in debt. This company has a good chunk of debt which gives them some additional leverage. To make this more normalized we can convert their market cap, the P in our P/S equation, to EV which stands for enterprise value. EV is calculated by taking the market cap and adding the debt and then subtracting the cash. So, for Company C that comes out to be 500 + 125 – 25 = 600. You can now use this to get their EV/S, which is six. This is higher than the five they had before because we took away their leverage. Now all companies can be compared on a more even footing. 

#**Conclusion**
Price to sales, or as we will now call it, EV/S, is generally considered to be the most effective fundamental ratio out there. Now, just because it is the best doesn’t mean you should use it alone. You should always use fundamental ratios as only one of many available tools. 
Now that the disclaimer is out of the way, let’s see how it does stack up even on its own so that we can give it a fair comparison to other ratios and ideas. Buying stocks with a low P/S ratio outperformed broad market indices 95% of the time during any 10 year period from 1953-2003. During this same period the lowest P/S stocks outperformed the highest P/S stocks by a factor of over 1,000. The stocks with the lowest P/S ratios had an average return of 17.46% and the stocks with the highest had an average return of 3.12%. Whether this will continue to work in the future is, as always, not guaranteed.
If you want to make use of this tool for yourself, use EV/S and make sure you look at profit margins. Between these two points you’ll have accounted for the two pitfalls discussed. Use it on similar industries and use it as part of a set. Thank you for reading. 

#**TLDR**
Price to sales can be misleading on its own, but you can mostly fix this by accounting for differing levels of cash and debt as well as by checking profit margins. This new ratio, after the adjustment, is called EV/S and it is the most effective fundamental ratio, at least on its own. It can be used on value stocks, growth stocks, and even unprofitable companies. Use it, along with other tools, to compare similar companies to find which one is most likely underpriced.

CcJenson,"Slashed dividends Almost completely to ""sure up"" accounting stuff and to focus on paying off more debts faster. This is what caused the drop. There are talks about them bringing it back even and ER IS TOMORROW with a conference to answer questions. Everything I have found on it seems like a solid and reasonable thing for a company to do in a bigger picture sense. They're making millions consistently. 

There was a second drama thing about refinancing one of their ships. Something about the client is hassling over contract stuff. Everything I've read here also didn't convince me in any way that they can't pay debts or anything like that. Imo it is a little bit of bad press and nothing beyond that. 

Assuming they can deal with the ship contact/ refinancing thing ( I think they will get it resolved without any real issues ) assuming that much, tho, this is a home run for a few month play depending on er and how long it takes to get some positive news in. 

My chips are in on this one and I think the risk reward ratio favors reward. They are simply too profitable to be worried and this was a dramatic overreaction imo! Trying to get the word out!",1,Taking a stake on HMLP could be a NICE play everything considered.

*Hi guys, so for all my life I've been a conservative and fundamentalist investor ( sadly it has not yielded me much of the gains I want ) and at my current age 20-30's i thought to myself if i won't take more riskier positions now as a young adult with no family depending on me. Then when should i take on more riskier portfolios and investment opportunities?*   


*Recently got into crypto and well boy let me tell you, Fundamental Analysis quickly goes out of the window here. It's unregulated, unenforceable, and most countries have no feasible legislation as to its implementation most especially with block chains and smart contracts ( it's basically the new technology which incorporated bitcoin's tech into having utility and purpose ). This is what sold me on crypto currency sometime last year actually when I saw first hand how a block chain network could actually provide utility now. As a fundamental investor on crypto I was sold. Now a decent chunk of my portfolio is in stocks and i'm looking to move it into crypto soon.*

  
To all fundamental analyst of securities and stocks in particular, I've personally been bothered by this for a long time. Why on good earth would a stock sell below its book value ? I mean I just don't get it. It should be no brainer that people should be buying out that stock because if that company closed down tomorrow you'd be getting your money's worth   


If a stock has a book value of let's say 10 usd per share and it's being traded on an exchange for 2 usd per share. Isn't this free 8 usd per share you're taking home ?

Justingolw,"Hey guys for the longest time I always thought that inflation was the only bad thing but after doing some research a bit now deflation is as equally bad as it causes:   


1.) delayed purchases ( people won't buy things knowing that their money would deflate in value so they can purchase that new house or new car for fewer monies the next year )   


2.) Deflation causes disruption in loans, bonds, treasury bills and etc. If the Goverment borrows money say 1,000,000 USD to obviously pay its creditors at a higher rate let's sa 2% so 1,020,000 USD because of deflation the purchasing power of 1,020,000 would now be higher than what was originally intended

My reasoning is that, since I don't have to pay taxes on my gains in this acct, the riskier plays are more justified. I'm sure there's a way to phrase this in terms of risk-adjusted, tax-adjusted expected returns.

Puzzleheaded_Bus_418,"Disclaimer: I’m long ~550 shares of Opendoor. 

OPEN recently reported a great Q2, beating estimates with revenue of $1.2B and a net loss of $143M. Q3 projected revenue from the company is $1.8-1.9B and unless I’m not understanding something correctly, I think they are about to post a $3B+ quarter in Q3.

Background: I used to spend 20-30 minutes a day looking through OPEN’s website and calculating the number of homes listed/sold. Was lucky to stumble upon ibuyerstats.com and I’ve found it to be fully reliable, saving me lots of time and it has some helpful analysis. 

Calculation: according to ibuyerstats.com, OPEN has listed 4,989 homes since July 1st. The total number of homes listed on OPEN (only homes that are OPEN owned, not just homes people list themselves) has increased by 503 since July 1st. So a simple calculation tells you that OPEN has sold ~ 4,500 homes so far this quarter. At an average selling price of $400k, OPEN has pulled in revenues of $1.8B in just 53 days (already what they were projecting for the whole quarter).

53 days is 58% of the days in a quarter, and when you add in the other 42% you get revenues of $3.1B, however this doesn’t include revenues from homes listed earlier than the start of Q3, their listing platform, and a general increase in sales that is likely to continue through the remainder of Q3. 

I’m completely open to any criticism as I’m genuinely curious if any of you think this simple calculation is a fair representation of the quarter OPEN is about to deliver. 

TLDR: OPEN looks like it may have a massive Q3.",1,Opendoor Q3 is going to blow away estimates

anushi45sahak,"Gold production from the eight largest miners is expected to increase by up to 3.1% in 2021.

This comes after the [industry’s top gold producers](https://www.nsenergybusiness.com/news/top-five-gold-mining-companies-world/) – Newmont, Barrick, AngloGold, Polyus, Kinross, Gold Fields, Newcrest and Agnico-Eagle – felt the effects of a 6.5% reduction in output to 24.98 million ounces in 2020, following lower ore grades, sale of assets, lower mill throughput and lower recoveries.

But data and analytics firm GlobalData [projects](https://www.globaldata.com/gold-production-top-eight-companies-expected-increase-3-1-2021-says-globaldata/) production from those companies to recover and reach somewhere between 25-25.75 million ounces in 2021.

The most significant falls in production last year were observed amongst the top three companies – Newmont (6.1%), Barrick (12.9%) and AngloGold (7.1%). The collective output from those miners declined to 13.7 million ounces in 2020 from 15 million ounces in 2019.

Vinneth Bajaj, associate project manager at GlobalData, said: “After a strong first quarter in 2020, Newmont’s production was impacted by lower ore grades at the Ahafo, Yanacocha and Merian mines and the temporary suspension of the Cerro Negro, Yanacocha, Eleonore, Penasquito and Musselwhite mines between March and mid-May. In addition, the sale of Red Lake and Kalgoorlie projects further reduced output.”

Lockdowns imposed by governments impacted gold production last year

For Barrick, several gold mines were forced to cease operations temporarily due to the government lockdowns imposed to stem the spread of coronavirus infections, including the Veladero, Pueblo Viejo and Porgera sites.

Meanwhile, the divestment of African assets by AngloGold was a major factor behind the fall in the company’s output in 2020.

LifeReboot___,"Hey guys, so I'm pretty new to options (\~1year), and I started out mostly doing short term bets, but recently I've been thinking about using Leaps in my long term investment portfolio.

The idea is simple, but first of all this is my thesis of the strategy:

* The market always go up in long term because of technology advancement, and economic activities.
* Bear market can happen, but usually last at most 5 years. (Probably the riskiest assumption in the entire strategy.)
* Consistent yearly investment into Leaps, for example buy $100k worth of Leaps every year for decades, or gradually increase the yearly investing amount with 5%\~10%.
* Buy OTM+10% SPY Leaps with 3 years expiry, then sell them after 2 years with 1 years left to expiry. (Obviously this part will need more thinking, but the idea is to have a consistent strategy, it can be buying ITM/ATM/OTM, or buying 0.5Delta, or sell every 1 year instead of 2, which I will need to run some back test to find out the best possible option.)

What I think this strategy is that it could outperform the market performance by the leveraging the market performance it self, and maintain a long term consistent (or gradually growing) exposure of SPY.

Obviously another criteria here is not to lose money or turn out wasting time because of the theta decay, that is why I would also sell the call options with \~1year before expiry.

To verify the strategy, I purchased SPX historical data from [historicaloptiondata.com](https://historicaloptiondata.com) and [cboe.com](https://cboe.com), to ""backtest"" the idea of this, because lack of skills in writing custom back test strategy, I only able to backtest manually with one variable at a time.

Because of the hassle of backtesting the strategy, I can only do simple backtest such as buying 1 option per year etc, but what surprise me is the average return of this said strategy are able to outperform dollar cost averaging SPY in the period of 2005-2021 for at least twice of the ROI.

What I'm trying to do next is to find a way or have someone write some back test strategy with the data, so I can run the strategy with more different variable to see if the results of outperforming is consistent, which may take some time.

BrokenYozeff,"Hi everyone, I'm looking for some advice on high short interest stocks, more specifically highshortinterest.com. I've dabbled a little bit at a time looking for about %5-10 gains at a time and have been getting pretty lucky. I'm pretty much just buying some amount of the highest short interest stock, waiting for enough of the short positions to close, then selling at about %5-10 gain. It's backfired on me once out of about 10 times, but there's no way this can really be the hidden gem of stock trading. What are some reasons to hesitate from this strategy? I've been fairly unsuccessful in most of my growth investments, so I'd like to know why this is working out for me. Is it all really just pure luck?

&gt;  
&gt;**Samsung surpassed Nestle as the world’s biggest dividend payer, with Rio Tinto, Sberbank and Sanofi also making the top five.**  
&gt;  
&gt;**The research, published Monday, said 84% of companies around the world either increased or maintained their dividends compared to the same quarter in 2020.**  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;**Dividends paid to investors are projected to hit $1.39 trillion in 2021, reflecting a recovery that’s stronger than expected, according to a new report from British asset manager Janus Henderson.**  
&gt;  
&gt;**The 2021 forecast for dividends is just 3% below the pre-pandemic peak, the firm found.**  
&gt;  
&gt;Dividend payments in the second quarter jumped 26% from the same period last year to $471.7 billion, just 6.8% below the levels seen in the second quarter of 2019. Janus Henderson projected that dividend payouts will return to pre-pandemic highs within the next 12 months.  
&gt;  
&gt;**The research, published Monday, said 84% of companies around the world either increased or maintained their dividends compared to the same quarter in 2020.**  
&gt;  
&gt;Much of the growth was attributed to companies restarting frozen payouts and issuing higher special dividends on the back of strong earnings. Underlying dividend growth in the second quarter, stripping out the effects of special dividends and exchange rates, was 11.2%.  
&gt;  
&gt;[Samsung](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/undefined) surpassed [Nestle](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/NES.N-CH) as the world’s biggest dividend payer, with [Rio Tinto](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/RIO-GB), [Sberbank](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/.FKRX300) and [Sanofi](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/SAN-FR) also making the top five.  
&gt;  
&gt;Samsung distributed a total of $12.2 billion to investors once its regular dividend was included, and Janus Henderson anticipates that it will likely be among the world’s top five payers throughout 2021.  
&gt;  
&gt;“The rebound has been so much stronger than we anticipated, and I think it is very encouraging that we are seeing these companies feeling strong enough to return cash back to shareholders,” Jane Shoemake, client portfolio manager for global equity income at Janus Henderson, told CNBC on Monday.  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;Geographical divergence  
&gt;  
&gt;**Payouts in the U.K. surged 60.9%, and in Europe climbed 66.4%, while most of the dividend cuts were in emerging markets**, the report said, reflecting the delayed impact from lower reported 2020 profits. It said dividend cuts in developed markets were “pre-emptive and precautionary.”  
&gt;  
&gt;**North America, meanwhile, saw record dividends in the second quarter, driven by Canada. However, payouts in the region had largely held up through 2020, meaning there was little rebound effect.**  
&gt;  
&gt;In Asia-Pacific outside of Japan, headline dividend growth was 45% annually in the second quarter, buoyed by Samsung’s one-off special dividend, with South Korea and Australia leading growth in the region. However, Singapore remained constrained by restrictions on banking payouts.  
&gt;  
&gt;Japanese dividend payments also remained robust in 2020, but still managed underlying growth of 11.9% year-on-year.  
&gt;  
&gt;**In emerging markets, however, dividends fell 3.2% annually on an underlying basis, pulled down by lower 2020 profits, while just 56% of emerging market companies raised or held dividends steady in the second quarter.**

&gt;  
&gt;Portfolio implications  
&gt;  
&gt;**Mining companies showed the fastest growth on the back of booming commodity prices, while industrials and consumer discretionary companies also bounced back strongly, the Janus Henderson research showed. So-called defensive sectors, such as telecoms, food and household products, maintained their characteristically consistent single-digit growth rates.**  
&gt;  
&gt;“In terms of the highest yielding sectors, the financial services and commodity sectors dividend outlooks are the most improved since last year,” said Ben Lofthouse, head of global equity income at Janus Henderson.  
&gt;  
&gt;The firm has been adding to positions in these sectors in its equity allocations over the past 12 months in a bid to capitalize on this rebound. Many banks and financial services companies were subject to regulatory restrictions on dividend payments during the pandemic, which are now beginning to lift.  
&gt;  
&gt;“The travel and leisure sectors remain hardest hit in terms of the Covid impact, and while many have adjusted operations to be able to survive, the sector is unlikely to be paying dividends until balance sheets recover, so we continue to avoid these for the time being,” Lofthouse added.",1,"Dividend payouts to hit $1.4 trillion in 2021, nearing pre-pandemic levels, research shows"

The world of finance is absolutely filled with people making claims about what’s good or bad, how you should or shouldn’t do something, and what you can and can’t achieve. My goal is to take a look at these claims, spend some time researching them, and then share what I’ve found. I’m going to investigate various strategies, ratios, indicators, portfolios, and general market concepts with the goal of determining which ones are just noise and which ones might help you get ahead. 

In this write up I’m going to be taking a deep dive into another incredibly popular metric – the price to book ratio. I’m going to start with a walkthrough of how you calculate it, then I’m going to cover how it should be used, then I’m going to go over some of the pros and cons of it, and most importantly I’m going to see if it gives you any kind of advantage when selecting stocks. 

#**What is P/B?**
A company’s price to book ratio is the ratio between the company’s current share price and their current book value per share. Book value is essentially the value of a company from the perspective of an accountant. Accountants don’t care about future earnings or potential speculation. They look at the current value of the business by taking all of the company’s assets and subtracting all of the company’s liabilities. This is then divided by the number of shares to get the book value per share. Once you have that you simply divide the share price by the book value per share to get the price to book ratio. 

#**Real Application**
Now I’m going to walk you through a real example. Total assets and total liabilities can be incredibly complex numbers to try and calculate, thankfully every public company will already have these numbers listed on their balance sheet which can be found on any number of websites. I grabbed Ford’s values from Yahoo Finance for this example. 

To find their book value you will be taking their total assets, which are things the company owns that have value and subtracting their total liabilities, which are things the company owes or is obligated to pay, like debt, interest payments, or workers’ wages. This is then divided by the number of shares in existence. This gives Ford a book value per share of 7.91. This means that for every $13.61 share - Ford has $7.91 of “real” value. Now the last step is to divide the price per share by this number which results in a price to book value of 1.72. 

Now before I can go into depth on how to interpret this number I need to explain the different ways to classify assets. Assets come in two forms, tangible, and intangible. This is important to know because it explains why some industries have significantly higher average price to book values than others. Tangible assets are most commonly physical things like factories, land, or machinery. However, they also include two less intuitive items which are cash and investment vehicles like stocks or bonds. The thing that all of these have in common is they have a relatively easy to find real monetary value outside of the company.

The other category of assets are called intangible assets which are things that are not physical and only have a theorized value. This can include copyrights, brands, or research. These have value but it’s far harder to put a price tag on them. In the standard price to book calculation the two will be added together if the intangible assets are given on the balance sheet. Another reason I defined both is because you will sometimes see people use price to tangible book value which means they did not consider intangible assets in their calculation. 

#**How to use P/B**
We calculated Ford’s price to book ratio as 1.72. Now like most fundamental ratios this seemingly random number each company has means absolutely nothing without some context. There is no definitive line of what defines a good or bad number because companies can have vastly different amounts of tangible vs intangible assets - and intangible assets are incredibly difficult to price. As with all fundamental ratios, you should only be using them as one of many data points to get an idea of how the business stacks up against similar competitors.

For example, a consulting firm with a handful of employees and one small office building could generate as much profit as the steel mill on the other side of town. But because the steel mill has a lot more physical assets it’s going to naturally have a much lower price to book ratio. These companies are effectively equal but if you use price to book blindly you won’t see them that way. This means that in order to get the most out of a price to book comparison you want companies that are within the same sector and often even within the same industry.

To illustrate this point, I calculated the average price to book ratio of all of the sectors over the past few years. The technology sector which relies heavily on intangible assets has an average price to book of 7.3 which is the highest. One interesting thing I found was that even among sectors that are very physical in nature the value varies by *a lot*. Industrials have an average of 4.8 whereas the energy sector has an average of only 1.65. 

But what do these numbers actually mean? The price to book value compares the current valuation of the company, which includes future growth and speculation, to their current value, according to the balance sheet. A price to book of 1.72 means that the stock price is valuing Ford at 72% more than what their current accounting value is. At the very least, this means that large investors have an idea of how much they’d lose if the company went bankrupt and needed to be liquidated. This tie to real value is one reason why value investors prefer low price to book ratios, although as we saw when looking at the sectors, low is relative. 

Let’s continue with the ford example and see how it can be used in practice. Let’s compare their 1.72 price to book value to tesla, who is the largest of all up and coming electric vehicle makers. Tesla has a price to book of 26.95 which shows that their price is almost entirely speculative and is incredibly disconnected from their current real value. For reference, the average price to book ratio for the automotive industry is about 4. You can see how Ford and Tesla stack up here. This doesn’t necessarily say that tesla isn’t something to buy, but it does say that it is a growth stock that people expect *a lot* from in the future. If tesla is not able to reach the levels of growth speculated it will appear to be a disappointment to its investors and has a lot farther that it can fall before it reaches a more stable price when compared to something like Ford. If Tesla fails miserably and goes bankrupt the shareholder is unlikely to get back more than a tiny fraction of their money. If ford fails miserably and goes bankrupt a large shareholder could potentially get more than half of their investment back – though the process of bankruptcy and liquidation is large and complex with varying results. 

#**What are the pros and cons of P/B?**
Price to book is a complex ratio that has a lot of implications. I’m going to go over a few of the benefits and shortcomings of it. Let’s start with the positives. 
* Price to book can be used on companies that have negative earnings. New companies that aren’t yet profitable are very common and without a positive net income can be difficult to compare to companies that are profitable. Many companies that aren’t profitable are still great businesses as long as they are heading in the right direction. 
* Price to book also offers investors a look into how much of the stocks price is based on real value and how much is based on speculation. This it is incredibly effective at separating growth from value stocks – so much so that the Russell indices use price to book for half of their decision weight when creating their value ETFs. 
Now let’s look at some of the potential downsides. 
* Price to book does not give any indication of how well a company is using its assets, only that it has them. If you have two companies that both have one million dollars’ worth of machinery and the same price to book ratio, you have no idea which one of those is actually making more money. This emphasizes the idea that you always need to look at a variety of  factors when trying to find good value companies. 
* Another downside is that it also struggles to incorporate intangible assets because they are often incredibly difficult to value. This makes comparisons between more physical and less physical companies nearly useless with this metric. 
* Lastly price to book value can vary from company to company because it relies on how that company does their accounting. This effect is even more pronounced if you try to compare companies from different countries. 

#**Does P/B give you any advantage?**
Now, can price to book value help you outperform the market by identifying undervalued stocks? It depends. The first thing it depends on is what type of company you are looking at. Price to book works far better on businesses that are physically intensive because the land, machinery, and factories all have significant real value. It also works well with banks and other financial institutions because cash, stocks, and bonds are all also considered tangible assets due to their easily identified real value. It does not work well when you are looking at intangible industries. Software companies, consulting firms, and pharmaceutical companies are all examples of highly intangible areas of business. 

So, if you are looking to compare tangible companies from a similar industry - price to book has historically been a fantastic predictor of value. The paper called “value vs glamor: a global phenomenon” goes into incredible depth regarding the performance of price to book value. From 1968 to 2008 the 10% companies with the lowest price to book value outperformed the highest 10% by an average of 9.3% annually. This is a massive amount and with this it is pretty clear why many index ETFs use price to book to build their value ETFs. 

However, it’s not all great news. The paper titled “price to book’s growing blind spot” which covers up until 2016, shows that the price to book ratio has been losing its edge in the last decade to the point where it has almost no benefit. This is a completely true phenomenon, but I want to explain why it may be misleading. 

The last 10 years have been a part of the strongest bull market in history and this market is being led by primarily technology stocks. If you recall, technology stocks are mostly intangible and therefore are not able to be judged accurately with this metric. It is up to you whether you think this trend will continue. If you do, price to book may not be a metric you want to use. However, if you are looking at the long term and expect the market to return to more historically average conditions then it is likely still an effective measure of finding value. 

#**Conclusion**
The price to book ratio has certainly earned its fame, at least historically. Aside from the past 15 years the price to book ratio has selected strong value stocks again and again. It’s up to you whether you want to bet for or against the current paradigm of the market which is dominated by intangible technology. This will determine whether or not you should make price to book one of your tools. 

###**TLDR:**
Historically P/B has been one of the best predictors of value. This trend has nearly completely disappeared in the past 10-20 years. This is likely due to the dominance of tech companies which are incredibly heavy on intangible assets. Ideally it should only be used as one of many data points when selecting a stock and should only be used to compare similar companies in similar industries. 

###**Mild subreddit self-promotion:**
If you enjoy these kinds of posts I created my own subreddit r/FinancialAnalysis where myself, and eventually others, will be doing this style of research.

Pfizer recently went to push Amarin's drug Vascepa in Canada [Link](https://www.newswire.ca/news-releases/hls-therapeutics-announces-promotional-agreement-with-pfizer-for-vascepa-r-in-canada-861060988.html)

Only time will tell.

This coming week Amarin's drug Vascepa will be prestented at ESC congess on Aug 29th with results showing it pay help treat COVID patients. If you can, I suggest to go watch the results that day.

Also last moment to trade shares once the COVID treatment results comeout will be on the Frankfurt exchange.

Recent article below by Amarin's CEO below. Put in bold what he said was important.

Then, in March 2020, U.S federal courts invalidated several patents for Vascepa, opening the door to generic competition and potentially shrinking sales of the company’s once-promising drug.

Amarin’s stock price fell by 50% virtually overnight.

The court rulings could have been a death sentence for a company like Amarin. Instead, it has rebounded with a risky, unusually aggressive strategy for a small drugmaker that markets and sells a single pill.

Karim Mikhail, Amarin’s CEO and a 22-year veteran of Merck, said the company will launch sales of Vascepa next month in the European Union and plans to expand into Asia and Africa next year. The company also has added sales staff to battle generic drugmakers for U.S. sales.

“People who fought for the value that this product brings to the market are not letting go today,” he said. “They risked their careers … to prove a point that this product brings enormous benefit.”

It plans to thread the needle to profitability with overseas sales and fighting off U.S. generic competitors by pushing doctors to prescribe Vascepa to more heart patients. Here in the U.S., it must do so by selling a drug that on average costs 77% more than generics.

J.P. Morgan analyst Jessica Fye still believes Vascepa will be successful, she said in investor notes, but sales will ramp up over 10 years.

This month, former Amarin CEO John Thero was succeeded by Mikhail, Merck’s former chief marketing officer in Europe and emerging markets. His appointment and the expansion of Amarin’s sales staff indicated the company plans to go it alone.

“Investors may be disappointed in the transition and that it may signal no near-term merger and acquisition on the table (which is the clear and primary bull case to the stock),” Jefferies analyst Michael Yee wrote in a recent investor note.

Big pharmaceutical companies typically buy up startups to avoid the risk and expense of drug development. But companies like Amarin are rarely acquisition targets, according to studies by Michael Kinch, director of the Center for Drug Discovery at Washington University in St. Louis.

Vascepa joins a long list of cardiovascular drugs over the past two decades dominated by blockbusters marketed by Pfizer, Merck, Schering-Plough and AstraZeneca.

The most commonly prescribed heart medicines are today available as low-cost generics. And generics typically capture 95% of the brand-name’s sales three months after generic drugs hits the market, according to Wall Street analysts.

The generic version of Vascepa, has not experienced that level of success.

Mikhail said Vascepa was notoriously difficult to manufacture and the raw ingredients difficult to acquire in bulk. “Clearly, the generics never thought they would win this case,” he said. “The evidence is they were not ready with supply.”

The FDA says Vascepa’s mechanism in action to reduce stroke and heart attacks is “not completely understood.” Amarin claims the drug has anti-inflammatory properties and it has announced several academic centers are studying Vascepa as a possible treatment for colorectal cancer as well as Covid.

Mikhail said preliminary Covid study data is scheduled for release next week at the European Society of Cardiology Congress.

**“You look at what Covid patients die from, they mostly die because of an inflammatory storm,” he said. “If the study is positive, and it has value in delaying progression in Covid patients … that would be incredible.”**

**It would also give Amarin another escape hatch to deliver shareholder value.**",1,$PFE buying $TRIL will $AMRN be next?

Kev762x51,"Hello guys,

I have a quick question about 3 401K's I have from some old jobs. I have 30k in a 401k from an old job (vested) and 2 other 401ks worth 5k and 5k (both didn't vest unfortunately). So 40k total.

I was going to leave the 5k plans alone, because they have been getting 18%-35% each year for the last 3-5 yrs. BUT I was under the impression that maybe putting them all together and 40k in an IRA would generate more money ""snowballing"" together vs starting with just the 30k + of course my 6k/yr contributions.

Also- note I wanted to do a ROTH IRA but since my 40k1's are pre-tax I elected to do a traditional IRA and maybe convert to ROTH in the near future. Just wanted to mention incase someone asked why not ROTH.

So to recap, my main question is, should I leave the 10k split between 2 different plans that are doing very very well (5K at UBS and 5k TSP) or add the 10k to my 30k, to make my new IRA 40k even.

$EAR (Eargo Inc) is a hearing aid manufacturer that is ""disrupting"" the market by selling customizable hearing aids online. They aren't for extreme hearing loss, but seem to be a good solution for mid-to-mild hearing loss. Their calling card seems to be that their devices are almost invisible, comfortable, long charges (16+ hours, I believe), and the devices can be controlled from a smartphone or with 'gestures' that adapt to different settings. *I don't know anything about hearing aids, so I'm just going by what I've read from reviews and reddit.* 

They dropped quite a bit after Q1 earnings despite beating EPS estimates, then dropped again with a big EPS miss in Q2, despite 44% YoY growth in revenue. Subsequently, the price has dropped about 70% from their February high to $21.48 as of Friday's close.

Dropping after a big EPS miss is not surprising, but dropping this much seems like an overreaction unless I'm missing something. They would seem to have a lot in their favor:

* They just launched their newest device (Eargo 5) very late in Q2, so one would expect significant revenue lift in Q3 and into the holidays once they put a marketing push behind the new product.
* [Early reviews](https://www.engadget.com/eargos-latest-smart-hearing-aids-bring-a-much-needed-hearing-test-160001810.html) on the new device have been strong as far as I can tell (overall their line of products seem to be well reviewed and very competitive on price). 
* On their Q2 presentation they alluded to making inroads with payer relationships. 
* Even without better payer coverage, [Biden's recent executive order](https://www.medtechdive.com/news/biden-order-takes-aim-at-high-cost-of-hearing-aids-calls-for-otc-sales/603114/) calling for OTC sales of hearing aids and directive towards fair pricing would seem to provide some future tailwinds for a company like Eargo, who is already significantly lower priced than higher end hearing aids. 
* The total TAM should be expanding. Its estimated that 17% of Gen Xers and 10% of Millennials [already experience some level of hearing loss](https://www.ameritasinsight.com/wellness/hearing/why-millennials-and-generation-z-employees-have-hearing-loss). It is naturally expected that those numbers will grow with age. A digitally-forward, stigma free hearing aid solution would seem like an ideal product for those generations.

alimessimourad,"Moving all noise aside and concentrating primarily on a business as if it was not even a public company is what counts (E.g Buying a bakery, hairdresser salon or anything else that produces cash). This will help you genuinely value a business without emotion. 

The most important aspect of a business is its ability as to how much cash it can generate on UNLEVERAGED net tangible assets. 

Alibaba's business is a lot more complicated compared to a simple hairdresser business but if you really only only concentrate on one business and analyse it thoroughly you will come to a ballpark figure.
 You wiol find that all internet based companies operate on hardly any Tangible assets which will allow them to generate piles of cash without plowing a tonne of cash into it every year. 

Alibaba is one of those businesses that can produce without the need of a shitload of Tangible asset re-investment. 
If you really look into their balance sheet and their returns you will see that alibaba is an extraordinary business running on very little UNTA (Unleveraged net tangible assets).
 
I can go on all day but we'll take a rough approach to last year's true earnings (without the EBITDA, or adding back Stock back compensation to earnings) they produced roughly $18 billion (adding back some amortization of intangible assets and the anti-monopoly fine paid but not adding depreciation of PP&amp;E because eventually you will need to reinvest that amount or close to it). In my opinion alibaba required app. $33 billion to operate which is give us about a 55% return on capital employed. An outstanding return for a company of this magnitude, remember this company is investing heavily is R&amp;D.

If you minus all liquid/net assets(which do account for something in the long run) you are virtually buying this company's for approximately $370B

When a company decides to split its stock for what ever reason they have and you are a shareholder but only have part of the shares needed to convert to a new stock, what happens to the partial stock shares that get called away? Are you paid for them or something? Having to pay for a re-structure of the stock already makes it seem like a bad choice to hold it during any splits in company’s favor right? Are there different rates for restructuring or are these pretty much the same for all of the brokers? Paying 40$ for a 3$ stock to split 6-1 is not right in my opinion but maybe I am missing something here, it has happened to me twice in a month and I keep getting called on it.

patmcirish,"I'd like to know the correct way to read the ""short volume"" data that's published on the FINRA website for individual stocks. 

For example, the company ATNF just yesterday (Aug 19) announced the issuance of 2.5 million new shares, and the price dropped from about $7 to about $5. There was already about 11% short interest on it as of Jul 30, and I'd like to get some idea of how many of the shorted shares were covered or how many were added just by reading the FINRA data for that day.

Looking at the data on this page: https://fintel.io/ss/us/atnf it says that the ""FINRA Short Volume"" for Aug 19 was about 681k. 

My question is, is that 681k all newly shorted shares, or does that include covering shorted shares? The definition given above that in the web page is:

&gt; FINRA Short Volume - Number of short shares traded reported by FINRA

When I see ""shares traded"", that implies both ways, which I would think implies shorting as well as covering. Shouldn't it be defined as ""Number of shares sold short as reported by FINRA"" if it was only shares sold short?",1,"Does FINRA ""short volume"" include shares covered or is it only shares sold short for a day?"

*\[…\] it’s not wise to just take the P/E at face value as there may be an explanation why it’s so limited.*

*Co-Diagnostics certainly has been  doing a good job lately as it’s been growing earnings more than most  other companies. One possibility is that the P/E is low because  investors think this strong earnings performance might be less  impressive moving forward.*

*Shares in Co-Diagnostics are going to  need a lot more upward momentum to get the company’s P/E out of its  slump. Using the price-to-earnings ratio alone to determine if you  should sell your stock isn’t sensible, however it can be a practical  guide to the company’s future prospects.*

*We’ve established that Co-Diagnostics maintains its low P/E on the weakness of its forecast for sliding earnings, as expected.*

The company, which has risen to prominence even  among non-*[*healthcare*](https://www.fool.com/investing/stock-market/market-sectors/healthcare/)  *investors because of its COVID-19 diagnostic products, said that its  revenue was $27.4 million.

### Methodology

For each stock from NASDAQ and NYSE scores are calculated for each of the following areas:

* Valuation
* Profitability
* Growth
* Health

The scores are calculated using the indicators shown in  colored boxes above. For instance, to assess stock’s profitability,  Return on Assets (**ROA**), Return on Equity (**ROE**) and **Net Margin**  are taken into account. The algorithm looks up the value of ROA in  every stock belonging to the same industry and compares it against the  analyzed stock, providing a final rank: if there are 20 stocks and 5 of  them have higher ROA, then the ROA-associated score is (20-5)/20 \* 100 =  75, meaning that the ROA is better than in 75% of stocks. We want ROA  to be higher than in the other companies; sometimes, however, we want  the indicator’s value to be lower than in peers, as is the case with  Price to Book ratio (**P/B**).

In the next step, the mean score across ROA, ROE and Net  Margin is calculated. Similar calculations are done for stock’s  Valuation, Growth and Health. The algorithm starts with Valuation score,  requiring it is at least 50/100. Then it proceeds with Profitability,  Growth and Health scores, each time requiring the score to be 50 or  higher. Finally, the mean value across all four areas of interest are  calculated. Only highest ranking stocks subjected to further manual  inspection.

&amp;#x200B;

### Definitions

**P/E** (Price to Earnings ratio): the ratio of a  company’s share (stock) price to the company’s earnings per share (EPS).  A high Price-Earning ratio indicates that investors are expecting  higher growth of company’s earnings in the future compared to companies  with a lower Price-Earning ratio. A low Price-Earning ratio may indicate  either that a company may currently be undervalued or that the company  is doing exceptionally well relative to its past trends. The long-term  average P/E for the S&amp;P 500 is around 16x.

**P/B** (Price to Book ratio): compares a company’s  current market value to its book value (where book value is the value of  all assets owned by a company). Except in the case of a small minority  of companies, like property companies and investment trusts that are  asset-based, book values can bear little or no relationship to true  values of the companies. In many of today’s companies, their most  valuable assets are not shown on the balances sheet and are therefore  not necessarily reflected in the company’s book value (e,g, copyrights,  intellectual capital). Despite the limitations of the price-book ratio,  academic research has repeatedly shown that stocks with low price-book  ratios tend to outperform stocks with high price-book ratios in the  United States and other stock exchanges.

**EV/EBITDA**: a popular valuation multiple used to  determine the fair market value of a company. EV stands for Enterprise  Value, while EBITDA represents earnings before interest, taxes,  depreciation, and amortization. A key advantage of EV/EBITDA is that it  is independent of the capital structure (i.e. the mixture of debt and  equity). Therefore this multiple can be used to compare companies with  different levels of debt. It also avoids the significant shortcoming of  the P/E ratio which can be materially affected by the level of leverage  in the company. As of Jan. 2020, the average EV/EBITDA for the S&amp;P  500 was 14.20. As a general guideline, an EV/EBITDA value below 10 is  commonly interpreted as healthy and above average by analysts and  investors.

**ROA** (Return On Assets): shows how profitable a  company’s assets are in generating revenue. It’s a useful number for  comparing competing companies in the same industry. The higher the ROA  number, the better, because the company is earning more money on less  investment. ROAs over 5 are generally considered good.

**ROE** (Return ON Equity): measures the profitability of  a business in relation to the equity. ROEs of at least 15–20 are  generally considered good. Whereas ROE compares net income to the net  assets of the company, ROA compares net income to the company’s assets  alone, without deducting its liabilities. Sometimes an extremely high  ROE is a good thing if net income is extremely large compared to equity  because a company’s performance is so strong. However, an extremely high  ROE is often due to a small equity account compared to net income,  which indicates risk.

**Net Margin** (Net Profit Margin): Net profit margin or  net margin is the percentage of net income generated from a company’s  revenue. Net income is often called the bottom line for a company or the  net profit. It helps investors assess if a company’s management is  generating enough profit from its sales and whether operating costs and  overhead costs are being contained. Net profit margin can be influenced  by one-off items such as the sale of an asset, which would temporarily  boost profits.

**EPS** (Earnings Per Share): calculated as net income  (also known as profits or earnings) divided by available shares. The  resulting number serves as an indicator of a company’s profitability.  The higher a company’s EPS, the more profitable it is considered to be.  What counts as a “good” EPS will depend on factors such as the recent  performance of the company, the performance of its competitors, and the  expectations of the analysts who follow the stock. Sometimes, a company  might report growing EPS, but the stock might decline in price if  analysts were expecting an even higher number.

**Quick ratio**: a ratio between quickly available or  liquid assets and current liabilities. A company with a quick ratio of  less than 1 cannot currently fully pay back its current liabilities. In  general, the higher the ratio, the greater the company’s liquidity.

**Current ratio**: a liquidity ratio that measures  whether a company has enough resources to meet its short-term  obligations. It compares a firm’s current assets to its current  liabilities. Acceptable current ratios vary from industry to industry.  In many cases, a creditor would consider a high current ratio to be  better than a low current ratio, because a high current ratio indicates  that the company is more likely to pay the creditor back. Large current  ratios are not always a good sign for investors. If the company’s  current ratio is too high it may indicate that the company is not  efficiently using its current assets or its short-term financing  facilities.

**D/E** (Debt to Equity ratio): used to evaluate a  company’s financial leverage and is calculated by dividing a company’s  total liabilities by its shareholder equity. In other words, it measures  the degree to which a company is financing its operations through debt  versus wholy owned funds. Higher-leverage ratios tend to indicate a  company or stock with higher risk to shareholders. What counts as a  “good” debt-to-equity (D/E) ratio will depend on the nature of the  business and its industry. Generally speaking, a D/E ratio below 1.0  would be seen as relatively safe, whereas ratios of 2.0 or higher would  be considered risky.

**LTDebt/Eq** (Long Term Debt to Equity ratio):  calculated by taking the company’s long-term debt and dividing it by the  book value of common equity. Similar to D/E, but long term debt is  applied there (debt that matures in more than one year).

**PEG** (price/earnings to growth ratio): a valuation  metric for determining the relative trade-off between the price of a  stock, the earnings generated per share (EPS), and the company’s  expected growth. PEG is a widely employed indicator of a stock’s  possible true value. Similar to PE ratios, a lower PEG means that the  stock is undervalued more. It is favored by many over the price/earnings  ratio because it also accounts for growth. Criticisms of the PEG ratio  include that it is an oversimplified ratio that fails to usefully relate  the price/earnings ratio to growth because it fails to factor in return  on equity (ROE) or similar factors. On the other hand, the PEG ratio  can offer a suggestion of whether a company’s high P/E ratio reflects an  excessively high stock price or is a reflection of promising growth  prospects for the company.

**P/S** (Price to Sales ratio): a valuation ratio that  shows a company’s market capitalization divided by the company’s sales  for the previous 12 months. It is a measure of the value investors are  receiving from a company’s stock by indicating how much are they are  paying for the stock per dollar of the company’s sales. Analysts prefer  to see a lower number for the ratio. A ratio of less than 1 indicates  that investors are paying less than $1 per $1 of the company’s sales.  Any number higher than 4 is commonly considered unfavorable.

**Gross margin**: a difference between revenue and cost  of goods sold (COGS), divided by revenue. In other words, it is the  sales revenue a company retains after incurring the direct costs  associated with producing the goods it sells, and the services it  provides. The higher the gross margin, the more capital a company  retains on each dollar of sales, which it can then use to pay other  costs or satisfy debt obligations.

**Piotroski F-Score**: a discrete score between zero and  nine that reflects nine criteria used to determine the strength of a  firm’s financial position. The Piotroski Score is used to determine the  best value stocks, with nine being the best and zero being the worst.

**Altman Z-Score**: the output of a credit-strength test  that gauges a publicly-traded manufacturing company’s likelihood of  bankruptcy. It uses profitability, leverage, liquidity, solvency, and  activity to predict whether a company has a high probability of becoming  insolvent. A score below 1.8 means it’s likely the company is headed  for bankruptcy, while companies with scores above 3 are not likely to go  bankrupt. Investors can use Altman Z-scores to determine whether they  should buy or sell a stock if they’re concerned about the company’s  underlying financial strength. Investors may consider purchasing a stock  if its Altman Z-Score value is closer to 3 and selling or shorting a  stock if the value is closer to 1.8.

**Div Yield** (Dividend Yield): a ratio (dividend/price)  that shows how much a company pays out in dividends each year relative  to its stock price.

**Payout ratio**: a financial metric showing the  proportion of earnings a company pays its shareholders in the form of  dividends, expressed as a percentage of the company’s total earnings.

**Beta**: a measure of a stock’s volatility in relation  to the overall market. By definition, the market, such as the S&amp;P  500 Index, has a beta of 1.0, and individual stocks are ranked according  to how much they deviate from the market. A stock that swings more than  the market over time has a beta above 1.0. If a stock moves less than  the market, the stock’s beta is less than 1.0. High-beta stocks are  supposed to be riskier but provide higher return potential; low-beta  stocks pose less risk but also lower returns.

**Volatility**: represents how large an asset’s prices swing around the mean price.

**MRQ**: Most Recent Quarter.

**TTM**: Trailing Twelve Months.

**Volume**: the total number of shares that are actually traded (bought and sold) during a period of time.

&gt;The number of new homes under construction has soared — to levels not seen since the housing market crash 14 years ago.  
&gt;  
&gt;**Why it matters:** Home prices have been [surging](https://www.axios.com/consumers-complain-high-prices-inflation-2143e88c-84a3-4908-9861-8dd1571636dd.html) as the demand for houses has [outpaced supply](https://www.axios.com/housing-demand-outpacing-supply-construction-816e1c64-d164-4cfd-9b83-9f40b3079b36.html).

&gt;  
&gt;**Driving the news:** There were 689,000 single-family homes [under construction](https://www.census.gov/construction/nrc/index.html) in July, the highest number since July 2007.  
&gt;  
&gt;""This  is clearly a positive sign given the remarkably low levels of inventory  on the market,"" Mortgage Bankers Association chief economist Mike  Fratantoni says.  
&gt;  
&gt;**Yes, but:** While the large  number likely means more new homebuyers will soon be able to move in, it  may also reflect the fact that it’s taking increasingly [longer](https://nahbnow.com/2021/08/builder-confidence-at-13-month-low-on-higher-material-costs-home-prices/) to complete a home.  
&gt;  
&gt;""I  expect there have been delays in construction, and that is why there  are so many ‘under construction,'"" Bill McBride, housing economist at  Calculated Risk, tells Axios.  
&gt;  
&gt;""The lack of building materials,  ready-to-build on lots, and labor shortages are slowing housing growth,""  Ali Wolf, chief economist at Zonda Economics, tells Axios.

&gt;This explains why the number of homes under construction is up even as the [pace of housing starts slows](https://www.reuters.com/world/us/us-housing-starts-fall-sharply-july-2021-08-18/).  
&gt;  
&gt;**State of play:** As of June, [new homes](https://www.census.gov/construction/nrs/pdf/newressales.pdf)  were being sold at an annualized rate of 676,000, a number that’s come  down from a high of 993,000 in January due to supply constraints.

&gt;An unusually high [76.6%](https://www.axios.com/housing-demand-outpacing-supply-construction-816e1c64-d164-4cfd-9b83-9f40b3079b36.html) of new homes sold were either still under construction or not yet started.  
&gt;  
&gt;While the supply of new homes has been ticking higher, completed homes represented a [record low](https://twitter.com/RenMacLLC/status/1419668494816264193) 10.2% of this supply.  
&gt;  
&gt;**The big picture:** It may be tempting to draw comparisons to the housing bubble, but that may be a mistake.  
&gt;  
&gt;""Builders  adjust their sales strategy depending on where the market is,"" Wolf  explains. ""For example, during the mid-2000s housing boom, builders  started a lot of speculative building to get ahead of the demand.""  
&gt;  
&gt;""Following  the crash, builders pivoted more towards a built-to-order model where  they would wait for a buyer to start most of their homes,"" she says.  ""The high number of homes under construction is partly telling us that  builders are building homes that they already have under contract.""  
&gt;  
&gt;**The bottom line:**  While the elevated level of construction raises warning flags, evidence  suggests it is more reflective of delays than frenzied speculative  building.  
&gt;  
&gt;""Since most of these are already sold, I don't think we are overbuilding, or that this will impact prices,"" McBride says.",1,New home construction has soared to its highest level since July 2007

I think Tesla, I know, original but everything points in that way for the company. They are growing at an astounding rate despite their size and are still looking to increase production of there vehicles 50% yoy for at least the next decade. Which would put them around 20 Mil by 2030.

That's just the surface, Elon has publicly stated that be believes that the energy side of Tesla's business (solar, batteries, etc) will be worth the same if not more then the automotive side.

I don't think that will be the most exciting part of tesla's business and today it was confirmed. The AI component of Tesla's business (self driving cars/robotics) will be the largest of them all. Ark invest projects that global revenue for autonomous cars and services could exceed 10 trillion by 2035, and I think Tesla will have a outsized chunk of this pie.

As a Mechatronics Engineering undergraduate, the things I see this company producing are just beyond astonishing, go watch Sandy Munro talk about Tesla's innovation, watch battery day and AI day and tell me that this won't be the biggest company in the world. They are innovating on things other companies have barely started and are doing at an accelerating rate.

From an investment standpoint it's a no brainer.

Initially held LVGO shares, that got acquired by TDOC. May be should have gotten out at that point, but that's hindsight.. TDOC is down quite a bit this year from all time high of ~300. I plan to hold it for couple years, but not sure if that's a good decision. Inputs? Not sure if average down is a good idea either.. looks like membership growth is not quite encouraging.

Last week saw the newest second-quarter earnings release from Teladoc Health, Inc. ( NYSE:TDOC ). The company posted revenues in line with expectations, at US$503m, while statutory losses ballooned to US$0.86 per share.

Teladoc is mitigating the expenses caused by the acquisition of Livongo Health, Inc. around a year ago. Net loss was US$(333.5)m for the first half of 2021 compared to US$(55.3)m for the first half of 2020. The second quarter and first half of 2021 include stock-based compensation expense of US$83m and US$169.3m, respectively, an increase of US$61m and US$129m, respectively, from the second quarter and first half of 2020, substantially reflecting higher expense associated with Livongo stock awards that continue to vest after the merger.

scarberia123,"For a long time, gene and cell therapies were a treatment option for the future. Now, the pace of development is moving at breakneck speed, with a number of firsts and $14.1 billion in financing collected over the initial half of the year.

The Alliance for Regenerative Medicine has documented the “acceleration on all fronts” in a new report looking at the first half of 2021.

Most notably was Intellia’s demonstration of CRISPR gene-editing in humans through phase 1 data for patients with transthyretin (ATTR) amyloidosis. But that’s not all for regenerative medicine, which includes cell and gene therapies, gene editing and tissue-based therapies.

Companies developing these therapies have collected $14.1 billion in the first half alone, which is 71% of what was raised during all of 2020. The alliance called this surge the strongest half on record. 2020 already broke financing records, with $20 billion, and the report suggests 2021 could exceed that total.

Cell-based immuno-oncology has for the first time surpassed gene therapy in financing, notching $6.6 billion compared to $6.4 billion, respectively. The broader category of cell therapy, including stem cell treatments for Parkinson's disease, meanwhile picked up $1.1 billion.

Regulatory milestones

Gene therapies and gene-modified cell therapy products are on track to notch the highest annual number of regulatory approvals. Three have already been approved. Bluebird bio’s Skysona nabbed an EU nod for the rare neuromuscular disease cerebral adrenoleukodystrophy. Bristol Myers Squibb and bluebird’s multiple myeloma CAR-T drug Abecma was cleared by the FDA in late March. And Bristol Myers’ long-awaited CAR-T liso-cel, now called Breyanzi, was approved in February.

Waiting in the regulatory queue in the U.S. and EU is Johnson &amp; Johnson and Legend Bio’s cilta-cel in multiple myeloma, which will compete with Abecma. Other companies have approvals pending around the world.

Even with these approvals, however, cell and gene therapies face hurdles once they are cleared for the market. Bluebird bio, for instance, has pulled back from European markets after failing to reach a consensus on pricing for the one-time treatment Zynteglo.

The pipeline is nevertheless filled to the brim with new therapies. The report counted 1,320 industry-sponsored trials underway worldwide, including 158 that are in phase 3. Academic and other research is responsible for an additional 1,328 non-industry trials including 85 late-stage studies.

Indications run the gamut of diseases, but are mostly concentrated in oncology for the industry-sponsored trials, followed by central nervous system (CNS) disorders and rare genetic diseases. Academic research similarly focuses on oncology, followed by infectious diseases and CNS.

CAR-T therapies, which take a patients’ own cells and power them up to fight cancer before being returned to the body, have been particularly dominate in R&amp;D. Abecma is one example, but the J&amp;J-Legend cilta-cel showed some promising data in June, with a 98% overall response rate in multiple myeloma. The therapy is currently being reviewed by EU and U.S. regulators, with a decision expected later this year.


More readouts are expected from Precision BioSciences and CRISPR Therapeutics, which are working on separate BCMA-targeted CAR-T therapies.

The alliance counts 566 companies as developing regenerative medicines and advanced therapies in the U.S. and 588 industry-sponsored trials with U.S. sites.

Poisedle10,"Remember: the stock market almost always goes down faster than it goes up in the short term


One of the sayings of David Gardner of The Motley Fool. If youre a day trader or short term investor you need to remember that the stock market ALWAYS goes down

Seriously. You can take that and test it. By any stock. Any of them. And nine times out of 10 no matter when you bought it- will be in the red by the end of the week

Stocks always go down. They say not to buy high and sell low but you're always buying high. At any moment you're buying a stock higher than it will be later in that week.. because in the short term they always go down. So it's impossible NOT to buy a stock high

And in many cases impossible not to sell it low. There's plenty of examples of a stock that never goes back up no matter how long you hold it. Look at tesla. It was steadily increasing for months until it hit $840 before it dropped. For anyone trying to follow the ""advice"" of ""just hold it"" instead of cutting their losses they would have lost tons of money and it never went back up..

More examples how it's impossible not to buy high and often times impossible not to sell low

The only times you can actually make money is if you hold it for a very long time. And being that it's impossible to beat the market you generally won't see that much rate of return. Unless you prove to be a better investor than the experts at Wall Street then the chances of making any serious money unless you already invested serious money would be pretty low. You have to have at least a few million dollars in the stock market to reliably make anything tangible..",1,Remember: the stock market almost always goes down faster than it goes up in the short term

Recent news- GoHealth and GoodRx Announce Exclusive Medicare Agreement

CHICAGO and SANTA MONICA, Calif., Aug. 2, 2021 /PRNewswire/ -- GoHealth, Inc. (GoHealth) (NASDAQ: GOCO), a leading health insurance marketplace and Medicare-focused digital health company, and GoodRx, Inc. (NASDAQ: GDRX), America's leading resource for healthcare savings, today announced an exclusive agreement to bring GoHealth's Medicare enrollment and engagement solutions directly to GoodRx users on the GoodRx platform.

Of the nearly 20 million people who come to GoodRx every month looking for savings, millions of them have Medicare, based on GoodRx's internal analysis, while many others qualify for the program each year as they age in. GoodRx consumers who want to explore Medicare coverage options and understand potential benefits or savings will be able to access information about GoHealth's market-leading Medicare plan selection solutions. Those who enroll in a Medicare plan through GoHealth have access to a suite of healthcare services to further improve health outcomes. For instance, GoHealth members will receive ongoing engagement and education around pharmacy options and prescription savings related to their Medicare Advantage plan to maximize the value of their prescription plan benefits.

GoHealth consumers will also have access to GoodRx prescription discounts on GoHealth's Encompass platform. GoodRx prescription discounts can provide savings of up to 80% from the pharmacy retail price and are accepted at over 70,000 pharmacies nationwide, including Albertsons, CVS, Kroger, Rite Aid, Walmart and Walgreens.

""We're excited to bring GoodRx into GoHealth's robust ecosystem of strategic partners. Prescription costs are a major financial barrier for many people, especially Medicare members, and GoodRx's platform is greatly beneficial to finding savings for our members. Through this strategic partnership, we are giving our members affordable choices to further improve health outcomes, while also helping GoodRx's users find and enroll in the right Medicare coverage plan that fits their needs, a real win-win,"" said Ben Miller, Senior Vice President, Strategic Partnerships at GoHealth.

GoodRx is one of the many strategic partners GoHealth has added to its Encompass technology, a proprietary engagement platform that maximizes members' utilization of their benefits once enrolled in a plan, ensuring that members receive the care they need. This agreement is part of GoHealth's ongoing commitment to improve access to healthcare in America.

""The strategic partnership with GoHealth adds critical information to our platform that helps users as they seek to understand and navigate the complex world of Medicare,"" said Doug Hirsch, co-CEO and co-founder of GoodRx. ""The level of Medicare expertise and service that GoHealth provides, combined with our prescription savings value proposition, creates immense value all around.""

Many-Coach6987,"Hi all,
 
I have a question that I can’t wrap my head around. It is with regards to a fair (I know it’s subjective tho) evaluation of a firm in difficult times.
 
Let’s take Biontech. Currently P/E in the 10s?! They will reap billions over the next years from COVID vaccines and their technology will likely lead to other innovations so let’s assume they grow 15% annually over the next 10 years. Their P/E would be around the same, maybe 20 (other indicators deem a fair valuation too) all that time.
 
In 6 years the markets crash for whatever reason and because everything does, so does the stock price of Biontech. But people still have diseases and revenue comes in. 
 
If the price plunges 50% with stable earnings/revenues……Would you agree with my conclusions:
 
1)     Biontech would be subject to an overcorrection leading to an undervaluation (P/E would be even lower), therefore likely to bounce back to some degree
2)     However the bounce back would only happen, if the markets loose the irrational emotions and stop panic selling. When that is over, the market will see the undervaluation and buy the stock
 
BUT: I just wonder for how long that could go. Is it possible, or being more precise, are there known examples where the markets have been low for a long time and with that the value of firms who do exceptionally well? That would be irrational.

I am asking since it makes sense to me to hold Biontech long term…10-15 years surely. But if a crash would come around and drag Biontech with it, I rather sell and take profits instead of buying the dips…because of the risk (however real that risk would be?!) that it takes forever to bounce back….
 
Hope this made sense and I am grateful for your thoughts.",1,Your input on the evaluation of successful firms in strong bearish times

Avid_Hiker98,"Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. shares slumped as much as -4.3% to a record low in Hong Kong on Thursday, extending a selloff in Chinese technology giants after Beijing hit the industry with a fresh round of regulations.

The crackdown wiped off nearly $1 trillion of market value from Chinese shares listed globally last month as it quickly expanded from antitrust and e-commerce concerns to private tutoring, data security and online content. Alibaba’s shares have slumped 29% this year compared to a fall of just under 7% for the Hang Seng Index. 

The selloff has prompted some global fund managers including Cathie Wood to dump their holdings in Chinese stocks over the past few months. In fact, some investors are questioning allocations toward Chinese assets altogether.

The new moves are incremental but investors are not at a point where they “will cease to price in any more additional policies,” said Shine Gao, fund manager at Taicheng Capital Management Co. “Even if the worst is over for big tech firms in terms of new regulations, we should expect that their growth won’t be what it was.”

""The TFD Initiative, whose members include major global financial institutions and leading service providers such as ABN AMRO, Santander Asset Management, ING Bank, SMBC, ANZ, Commonwealth Bank of Australia, Texel Group, NN Investment Partners and more, recognises the vital role blockchain will play in shaping the future of the trade finance sector, which has already been successfully implemented in other areas of finance.

A first-of-its-kind, public-private hybrid blockchain platform, XDC Network brings energy-efficient smart contract and digital asset technology to the trade investment class.

Chris Southworth, Secretary General, ICC United Kingdom who is an observer on TFD Initiative said: ""Trade finance is a compelling asset class for institutional investors. Making trade finance more accessible for non-bank investors is of paramount importance if we are going to drive the economic recovery from Covid and fill the USD 3-5 trillion SME trade finance gap. Innovative technology driven solutions like the TFD Initiative are a critical part of the solution to providing more liquidity into the market.""

Leveraging the power of cryptographic tokens, the XDC Network allows for the digitisation, tokenisation, and swift settlement of trade transactions, reducing reliance on complex foreign exchange infrastructures.

Today as I sipped my coffee in my backyard I was keeping my ear to the streets as I normally do in the latest financial gossip. I’ve recently heard about the new craze that is seemingly lingering longer than I thought it would. Non-fungible tokens or NFTs are being ushered into the millennial and zoomer populations by creatively bankrupt Hollywood has-beens and noteworthy celebrities. Lindsay Lohan and other bold innovators of the investor class like Soulja Boy and Mark Cuban. Both of them are well known for their reliable and professional investment advice and business savvy. Cuban who has recently been an avid promoter of the Wallstreet bets pump and dump movement and Soulja Boy who was recently sued by Nintendo over his cheap Chinese knock-off video game consoles violated more than a dozen copyright laws. 

Honestly, my first impression of these NFT’s is a bit on the cynical side. Perhaps it is just my overactive imagination paired with a sense of dark humor. But I truly see people buying these NFT’s as a sign of the apocalypse. The concept wasn’t totally foreign to me. Video gamers have been using digital inventory for real-world currency for a long time. Online communities tend to have websites that facilitate in real-world trade of money for in-game items or digital loot drops from other players. Online trading card games have had digital copies of rare cards that are commonly traded for money too. Online party hats in a video game called Runescape sold for 7 thousand USD between private sellers. But are we really at a stage in the economic cycle where the best course of action is to buy digital content to pad your portfolio? 

Are we really at a moment in history where people are actually purchasing a Lindsey Lohan NFT for 17 thousand dollars? Is dancing GIFS of Mark Cuban to your portfolio really going to be a solid item for your child’s financial future? Will AMC one day let us pay for our movies with Zuckerberg GIFs or pre-expulsion Trump Tweets? Will canceled celebrities have to sell their NFTs in shady alleys and on street corners within flash drives? I don’t truly know and I don’t want to pretend to know the answer. While it’s really easy to cherry-pick from the dregs of the Hollywood influencer types. There is real money being moved by major players in the digital market. A GIF of a cat-poptart hybrid called “Nyan-Cat” sold for 450 thousand dollars and Kings of Leon’s album sold for 6 million dollars respectively. 

In both instances, the content is already released to the public. The owners don’t collect any revenue or royalties anytime the GIFs are used or the albums are played. In fact, the only thing gained is a sense of ownership within our digital world. While the world stands on the brink of opening up, the flood of money into online and virtual assets is staggering. Why buy real estate when you can buy virtual real estate? There was an old saying by Mark Twain. “Buy land, they aren’t making any more of it.” I can’t help but reflect on that as I see more and more of the virtual space be paved. How much farther into technology is society really trying to dive in and how much are people really willing to invest into this frontier? 

On one level this seems to be a desperate attempt for people with influence to make money from their followers by truly trying to offer them the clout of virtual asset ownership instead of conventionally making products to sell to them. On another level, this is pop culture and pop art manifesting its own free market. I don’t believe the Government will get involved yet in a major capacity on either side of the pendulum either. I think the government trying to restrict the sale of virtual art is about as likely as them releasing their own NFTs of what’s within area 51 or who killed JFK. 

But on another level, I also think that NFTs are a way where people can support their content creators and help support them in more meaningful ways beyond a tip. Instead of donations and handouts, people are now able to get collectibles and memorabilia that might hold and maintain some value as opposed to nothing. We live in a world where artists and entertainers stream a variety of content to their fans and audiences. The idea that the words we utter, the pictures we take, and our online memories can all be bought and sold are a new chapter in this digital economy. In today’s day and age, you’re money.",1,My Thoughts On The NFT Craze

Csweetstevy9,"Sorry in advance for formatting issues. I am on mobile at work. 

So I recently graduated college and finally have some steady income and of course investing has sparked my interest. One thing I don’t quite understand is the difference between buying stocks/shares and investing directly with the company?

For example there is a small company that started up about a year ago in the city I live in and they have been expanding and growing rather quickly. I am interested in investing in them. On their website they have a link where you can invest but with a convertible note. I’m unclear what this means or translates to. Does this mean they do not have shares to buy? Any help in clarification would be much appreciated.",1,Help understanding these differences.
supbrother,"Maybe this isn't the best sub for this, but I tried r/personalfinance first and got zero help, so this seemed like the next best place I could think of.

I'm in a situation with a masters program application a couple months from now where I'll need to prove I have a certain amount of money via a bank statement. Basically since tuition is free in this country (Norway) they require you to provide bank statements showing that you have enough money to support yourself (they won't accept brokerage accounts). I have more than enough money saved and invested, I just don't want to make a taxable event by selling assets simply to get cash in my account, pull a statement, and then put it right back in the brokerage. An alternative I found sounds tempting: withdraw contributions from my Roth IRA, get it in my checking account temporarily, then put it right back in the Roth. From what I've read, this is considered a ""rollover"" into the same account and is okay with the IRS so long as it's returned within 60 days. So my question is, is this a reasonable alternative to get cash in my account temporarily, or is there something I'm missing that may bite me in the ass?

Disclaimer: I know someone will say that I should sell the assets now if I intend to use them in the near future, and you're not wrong. But at my current savings rate I will have the required amount saved by the time I need it, and I'd rather have this money keep working for me in the meantime.

ccosta36,"Hi everyone, I am looking to buy a multifamily house to house hack, I have about 50 Series EE bonds from when I was a kid. If you did not know a Series EE bonds is suppose to double in value in 20 years. The rates are pretty low for these bonds. The earliest bonds I have is 1996 going all the way to 2011. Some bonds are close to maturity where others basically have very little interest. Final Maturity for a 2011 bond is around 2041 meaning ill be 45 years old. An example I have is a bond at face value of $250 in 2011, after going to irs.gov it is valued at $265ish after 10 years. 
I calculated the overall cash value of my bonds as of today is around $6,800. Which could really help buy a property. 

My overall question is should I cash my bonds and put it all towards a down payment? Seems that id make more money generating income from a property over the long term. Will inflation make it easier to recoup my losses in the future as $250 today is probably worth more than $500 in the year 2041.

I like to use SoFi for investments and like their automated investing feature. Do you think it would be wise to keep our wedding funds into a conservative account, rather than just sit in a normal bank account which is losing due to inflation?

I originally had it in a moderately conservative account which is 30% stocks, 70% bonds but noticed I was losing money due to the current market. For this particular account, I’m not comfortable with too much risk or the prospect of losing more than I gain. So I switched it to 100% bonds. 

Was this a wise choice to put our house savings into a lower risk investment account rather than just have it sit in a regular bank account? Or should I just transfer it to our savings account for our regular bank? Also, was I smart to switch it from 30% stocks 70% bonds to 100% bonds to minimize risk?

No_Try_5797,"I posted this the other day on r/StockMarket and r/ValueInvesting got wonderful responses so I thought I’d share it here too. Now, I understand that some of you may have already seen this if you follow either subs (I couldn’t post here because I didn’t have enough karma). I share it fully acknowledging that fact. Nonetheless, I do think some of the points below can be beneficial for some people.

## Key points:

* A lot of everyday investors make investment decisions without understanding what they’re really investing in. Most people speculate, don't be most people.
* Investing is an informed decision on the basis that your shares (or any other asset) will one day earn more money, and therefore be worth more, than what you paid for it; Not the other way around.
* Invest like a landlord. If you choose to invest in a company, you should follow earnings of your shares as if you were a landlord collecting rent, quarter by quarter I recommend using owner’s earnings. After all, they are your earnings.
* Investing in individual companies is well worth it as long as you adopt the right mindset. The earnings automatically come to you, you have extremely capable and smart people literally making money for you, and you are taxed less than your income!

## Investment guidance is fragmented and confusing

The investing space is highly fragmented, filled with a dubious amount of noise &amp; misinformation, and can be downright confusing. But investing at its core is straightforward. With the proper knowledge and framework, you can accumulate a lifetime of wealth.

## What is investing?

Investing is the act of foregoing a dollar today to get more dollars tomorrow... plain and simple. It is an informed decision, based on logic and facts, on the premise that the asset you're investing in will produce valuable goods and services that will one day exceed what you paid for to acquire the asset. This applies to all sorts of investments — stocks, property, bonds, a cornfield, etc. Regardless of the asset, investing remains the same throughout. In the context of stocks, this is reflected in their earnings, i.e. how much will company earn for the duration of your investment.

## What investing is not

Investing is not buying an asset in hopes that someone else will buy it for more than you paid for. In the context of stocks, investing has nothing to do with how much the price of a stock has gone up or down and trying to sell at it's peak. Banking on someone more [foolish](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=&amp;cad=rja&amp;uact=8&amp;ved=2ahUKEwiVroao_K3yAhVb7nMBHUtJAmEQFnoECBEQAQ&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.investopedia.com%2Fterms%2Fg%2Fgreaterfooltheory.asp&amp;usg=AOvVaw1LHhubcsWAa0-XwEi5S6MT) to buy subpar and unproductive assets from you is speculative and unsustainable. This is gambling not investing — a recipe for disaster.

Likewise, statements such as “the US government is pushing for clean energy initiatives and therefore, Tesla stock will be going up"" or ""Amazon reported sales growth of 40% so the stock is a buy"" are worthless. This is wishful thinking and is lazy. Companies make money because they produce goods and services people are willing to pay for and have structural advantages that make them preferable to their competitors and therefore earn more.

Investing in a stock is not buying a piece of paper hoping the sucker goes up nor is it some form of wishful thinking. Most people think like this and lose money. Don't be most people.

## Become a landlord

To become a good investor, you must think like a landlord. What I mean by this is just like a landlord keeps track and collects his rent every month, you must track and total the earnings of your shares. Understand where they come from and ignore how much your shares have gone up or down. When the value of your property falls 10%, you don’t sell it. You look at your rents and whether or not your rents has also been negatively affected. The same applies for stocks.

And the best part? You don’t have to do any work such as maintaining, marketing and, selling your property as long as you do proper research. Your earnings are reported automatically, you don’t have to collect them, or worry if people pay late. Why would you not invest if every time Apple sold an iPhone, a percentage of that money goes to you?!

*A few of you might think that you should just track dividends because dividends are what you're receiving. This is misguided. You must track the totality of earnings as some earnings will be retained to reinvest in the business and grow future earnings. This figure is known as owner's earnings and can be calculated relatively easily. More on this next time.*

## Many people speculate, few invest

Investing is pretty simple to understand, but difficult to execute. The first step to becoming a good investor is to start thinking like one and stop speculating all together. Statistically and anecdotally speaking, most retail investors fall into the speculative camp. This, by the way, extends to ""long-term investors"" who, in their best intentions, invest in companies in industries they believe to be the ""future"" but aren't able to pinpoint the earnings and returns of the companies they're investing in. If you're not going to track your returns, the money that you are earning/accumulating as a shareholder every quarter, and your subsequent yield then do not invest in individual stocks. Doing so is not investing! It is merely wishful thinking clouded by euphoria and misguided beliefs.

Instead, invest in an ETF that mirrors the S&amp;P 500 every month, do not touch it and let your money compound over time. It will provide satisfactory returns... much better returns than most investment vehicles.

However, I would really urge you to consider investing in individual companies. It is well worth it (this [chart](https://www.barrons.com/articles/berkshire-hathaways-investing-returns-a-breakdown-by-numbers-51582633800) says it all\].) I might make a post on why you should invest in individual companies and how to figure out what companies are worth investing in or not. Let me know if you’re interested.

*Also, if any of you can suggest which other subs could benefit from this post, please let me know. I’d love to engage in a conversation across multiple subs.*",1,The Biggest Misconception about Investing

KingTimKap,"Home Depot shares tumbled 4% in premarket trading Tuesday after the company said fewer customers visited its stores during the fiscal second quarter as pandemic-fueled do-it-yourself projects tapered off.

The home improvement retailer also didn’t provide a full-year outlook in its earnings release.

While Home Depot’s quarterly profit and revenue beat Wall Street estimates, same-store sales came in slightly below expectations as the company lapped a period a year earlier when customers flocked to its stores to buy paint, wood, gardening supplies and other materials for home remodelling projects.

U.S. same-store sales were up just 3.4% in the latest quarter, compared with a 25% jump in the year-ago period.

Here’s how the company did for its fiscal second quarter compared with what Wall Street was expecting, according to a survey of analysts by Refinitiv:

\- Earnings per share: $4.53 vs. $4.44 expected

\- Revenue: $41.12 billion vs. $40.79 billion expected

For the three months ended Aug. 1, net income grew to $4.81 billion, or $4.53 per share, from $4.33 billion, or $4.02 per share, a year earlier. Analysts had been looking for $4.44 per share, according to a Refinitiv survey.

Revenue climbed 8.1% to $41.12 billion from $38.05 billion a year earlier. That topped expectations for $40.79 billion.

Total same-store sales rose 4.5%. That was short of the more than 5% growth anticipated from analysts polled by StreetAccount.

The company reported a 5.8% drop in customer transactions compared with a year earlier, but the average ticket was 11.3% larger. Sales per retail square foot grew 5.3% year over year to $663.05.

Inflation could be one factor boosting sales. Analysts say lumber prices peaked during the latest quarter.

Home Depot faces tough comparisons with a year earlier when its brick-and-mortar stores remained open during the pandemic, and many Americans invested in remodelling projects.

lib3rty47,"Michael Burry is the latest investor to reveal a bet against the ETF, according to Scion Asset Management's second-quarter 13F filing. Burry initiated the new position by buying $31 million worth of puts in the ARKK ETF.

Burry's not the only one, as the Disruptive Innovation ETF has a 30-day put-to-call ratio of 1.8, meaning more people are buying bearish put options on the fund than bullish call options.

Other investors are outright shorting shares of the ETF, with short interest currently sitting at a record high 11.63%, according to data from Koyfin. With 21.58 million shares sold short as of Friday, the bet against ARK Invest's Disruptive Innovation ETF now totals $2.6 billion. 		

Burry's bet against ARK is likely tied to his conviction that Tesla is a short, given that Scion Asset Management's largest position is a $731 million put position in the electric vehicle manufacturer, representing a whopping 35% of his fund's more than $2 billion in assets under management.

China’s market regulator issued draft rules on Tuesday aimed at stopping unfair competition on the internet, as Beijing continues its broad crack down on the country’s technology sector.

The rules published by the State Administration for Market Regulation (SAMR) cover a wide range of areas from prohibitions on the way companies can use data to stamping out fake product reviews.

Chinese listed technology stocks in Hong Kong fell sharply on that news. Gaming giant Tencent was 3.5% lower in late morning trade, while e-commerce giant Alibaba fell 2.5%.

SAMR’s latest rules continue Beijing’s regulatory assault on China’s technology giants.

Here are some of the other key rules outlined:

Operators should not provide false data, such as the number of clicks on a piece of content;
Operators should not conceal negative reviews and only promote positive reviews;
Internet platforms should not use data, algorithms and other technical means to influence user choices, or other methods to carry out so-called traffic hijacking. This is where a company looks to redirect a user to their own website or service while they’re browsing another;
Operators should not use data and algorithms to collect and analyze competitors’ trading information.
SAMR said it could hire third-party institutions to audit data if an operator falls foul of the rules.

SAMR said it could hire third-party institutions to audit data if an operator falls foul of the rules.

The regulator is seeking public opinion on the new rules until Sept. 15. They have not yet come into effect.

However, SAMR’s draft rules highlight the market regulator’s push to tighten the laws around antitrust and competition. Earlier this year, the authority promulgated antitrust guidelines for the so-called platform economy.

The regulator has also been taking action against China’s technology giants.

Alibaba was slapped with a $2.8 billion fine in April as a result of an anti-monopoly probe, and SAMR is currently investigating food delivery firm Meituan for “suspected monopolistic practices.”

And last month, the SAMR blocked Tencent’s plan to merge video game streaming sites Huya and DouYu on antitrust concerns.",1,"China seeks to tighten rules on unfair internet competition, sending tech shares lower"
the_ITman,"Few months ago my friend was referred to this broker through another friend. The broker is Dave Clarkson (working for an investment firm called [The Investment Center](https://investmentcenter.co.uk/), UK).

She sent him $5,000 3 months ago and he helped set her up a Binance account, which he manages. She also has access to this Binance account. Today she has hit $15,000 on that account. I was stumped at this 300% return so on questioning her further she says that almost everybody who is investing through this broker, which is a majority of her friend group, is making massive returns.

For example, one of her close friends took a loan of $40,000 at the start of this year, and is now regularly withdrawing $20,000 every month since past 3 months.

Another close friend of hers in the same friend group is profiting more than $100,000 a year through Dave Clarkson.

She said I should invest too, so I started doing my due research online. I found out they are not registered with [FCA UK](https://www.fca.org.uk/news/warnings/investment-center).

Using my web development background, I found there are 2 other exactly similar websites to the [Investment Center UK website](https://investmentcenter.co.uk/) (just different branding):

2. [Top Market Cap](https://topmarketcap.com/)

And the [reviews for Walton Chase](https://au.trustpilot.com/review/waltonchase.com) do not look so good. 

Red flags I can identify:

1. The above reviews for Walton Chase (which seems like the same firm)
2. My friend sent me the UK phone number of Walton Chase - his profile picture is just a stock bitcoin image.
3. I cannot find much on the internet if i google for Dave Clarkson, or his phone number or about The Investment Center.
4. They are now calling her almost twice every week asking to invest more money.
5. On some posts on the internet I can see that they claim they have 20 years of experience in the investment sector, but their website was only active since March 2020 (using Way Back Machine).
6. 300% return in 3 months !

&amp;#x200B;

I have discussed this with my friend and she has discussed with her other friends, and they think that as these are very high risk investments, they have very high returns, and also very high chances of losing the investment. So people who lose their investments end up posting bad reviews online. My friend and her friend group are not really convinced this is a scam and want to keep investing.

I'm trying to wrap my head around this fund. It looks like it's a ""fund"" made of 5 funds. 

1. 10%: **The Dow Jones U.S. Select REIT Index** (looks to be mostly in ""blue chip US REITs, e.g. $O, $PLD)
2. 25%: **The Bloomberg Roll Select Commodity Index** (Commodity Futures, precious metals)
3. 25%: **S&amp;P Global LargeMidCap Commodity and Resources Index** (looks to be invested in material and natural resource companies, e.g. $FMC, $XOM, $RIO, etc.) 
4. 20%: **S&amp;P Global Infrastructure Index** (kind of like #3 but more focused on utilities and energy, $NEE, $ENB, $SO). 
5. 20%: **The Bloomberg Barclays US Government Inflation-Linked 1-10 Year Bond Index** (TIPS) 

This seems like a decent inflation protection fund. The fund has an expense ratio of 0.23%. I'm not sure how expense ratios work, but I would guess that means there's the also the expense ratios behind these 5 funds as well? So the overall expense ratio might actually be a lot more?

I have 70% in US Stock Index (55% SP500, 15% small/mid cap index), 20% in international, and 10% in this ""Real Asset Fund"". 

Do you all think that is wise? I feel adding this fund might help me take advantage of rebalancing and also throw in some value. Do you think 10% is too little or too much?

I rather not keep cash in a retirement account with an employee match. And I don't know how I feel about bonds right now.

cookingboy,"SpaceX raised its most recent round earlier this year at a $75B valuation. I currently have an opportunity to buy shares at $850/share, or roughly $150B valuation, through an SPV (special purpose vehicle). Considering it's a private company very minimal amount of information is available. As impressed as I am when it comes to their technology I do think there is a very good reason that seasoned institutional investors flooding with cash still only valued them at $75B just a few months ago. 

What complicates things a little is that I had bought shares before at a lower valuation (roughly $55B), but whenever I see new development from the company I regret my decision for not having put in more money. But again, I honestly have zero clue in how to properly value something like SpaceX and ""buying shares in cool/promising company at any price"" was what made me buy Coinbase at IPO lol....

$POWW keeps beating Analyst earnings est. Analyst 1st Qrt est. of $0.06 POWW reports $0.13

$238mil in backlog orders.

**SCOTTSDALE, AZ, August 16, 2021 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE)** — AMMO, Inc. (Nasdaq: POWW, POWWP) (“AMMO” or the “Company”), a leading vertically integrated producer of high-performance ammunition and components and operator of GunBroker.com, the largest online marketplace serving the firearms and shooting sports industries today announced results for its first quarter of fiscal 2022 ended June 30, 2021.

**First Quarter Fiscal 2022 versus First Quarter Fiscal 2021:**

●Net revenues increased 360% year-over-year to $44.5 million ●Marketplace revenue was $12.3 million reflecting the acquisition of GunBroker.com ●Gross profit margin was 42.7% compared to 11.1% ●Net income was $9.5 million compared to a net loss of $3.1 million ●Diluted EPS of $0.08 compared to ($0.07); Adjusted EPS of $0.13 compared to ($0.01) ●Adjusted EBITDA was $16.3 million versus a loss of $0.3 million ●Backlog of $238 million

“We delivered solid first quarter results, exceeding estimates for revenue and Adjusted EBITDA. Core ammunition sales were up more than three-fold reflecting strong underlying demand for our unique, high-performance products. We also added over $12 million of high-margin Marketplace revenue with the GunBroker.com acquisition that closed in April,” said Fred Wagenhals, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of AMMO, Inc. “Integration efforts are advancing on schedule and we are working on several major initiatives to further accelerate growth across our powerful Marketplace platform. Construction of our new manufacturing facility is also on track and we continue to make progress with new product development and government contracts. I am very proud of our team’s commitment and execution in driving significant value for all stakeholders.”

**First Quarter Fiscal 2022 Results**

Net revenues of $44.5 million were up 360% versus last year driven by strong growth in Ammunition and incremental revenue from the acquisition of GunBroker.com. Ammunition sales totaled $28.4 million compared to $6.4 million in last year’s first quarter, an increase of 342%. Marketplace revenue was $12.3 million reflecting the GunBroker.com business we acquired on April 30, 2021.

Gross profit was $19.0 million in the first quarter versus $1.1 million in the year-earlier period due to the increased sales of Ammunition coupled with the addition of our Marketplace segment, which included GunBroker.com. Gross profit margin was 42.7% in the first quarter compared to 11.1% in last year’s first quarter reflecting the impact of our higher margin Marketplace revenue.

Operating expenses were $9.3 million for the first quarter of fiscal 2022 compared to $3.9 million for the first quarter of fiscal 2021. The increase was attributable to operating the GunBroker.com business for approximately two months, higher commission payments stemming from growth in our Ammunition sales, higher stock-based compensation expense, and professional fees related to the acquisition of GunBroker.com. As a percent of sales, operating expenses declined to 20.9% in the first quarter of fiscal 2022 from 40.0% in the year-earlier period reflecting operating leverage, manufacturing scale and the mix shift in favor of higher margin Marketplace revenues.

Operating income for the first quarter of fiscal 2022 was $9.7 million compared to an operating loss of $2.8 million in last year’s first quarter.

Net income was $9.5 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2022 compared to a net loss of $3.1 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2021. Net income available to common shareholders was $9.2 million or $0.08 per fully diluted share versus a net loss of $3.1 million and ($0.07) per fully diluted share in the first quarter of fiscal 2021. Adjusted net income per share was $0.13 in versus an adjusted per share loss of ($0.01).

Adjusted EBITDA was $16.3 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2022 compared to an adjusted EBITDA loss of $0.3 million a year earlier.

**Outlook**

We are increasing our fiscal 2022 revenue guidance from $190 million to $210 million, including reiterating our expectation for second quarter fiscal 2022 revenue of at least $51 million. We estimate third quarter fiscal 2022 revenue will be approximately $60 million. We are increasing our Adjusted EBITDA guidance for fiscal 2022 from $65 million to $70 million.",1,"$POWW blew away earnings again, and raised 2022 Rev Guidance!"

Yes there are now less outstanding shares, but the company now has less cash. All the company has done is swap some of their cash for some stock. The company is no better off. The only reason why I can see share buybacks increasing share price is that maybe the public thinks that the company has more confidence in their stock because they think it is undervalued.

\+ Announced final results from its Phase 1 double-blinded, randomized, placebo-controlled clinical study using Atossa’s proprietary drug candidate AT-301 administered by nasal spray. AT-301 was considered safe and well tolerated in healthy male and female participants in this study at two different dose levels over 14 days.

\+ ""The intended mechanism of action of AT-301 is to prevent virus entry into human cells by inhibiting the obligatory Spike Protein activation.

Let’s talk about the timeline on Phase 3 for Endoxifen. FDA 505(b)(2) may bring Endoxifen to market without the need of Phase 3.

As discussed in this video: [https://youtu.be/rmuCfrJ8Se4](https://youtu.be/rmuCfrJ8Se4)

\&gt; \[Interviewer\]can you shed some colour on what maybe a phase 3 study may look like … since the FDA is already familiar with Tamoxifen and it’s outcomes…?

\&gt; \[Dr Quay\] .. first of all it’s very hard to answer that, but I think one of the things we have talked about in the past is that there’s a pathway called 505(b)(2) which allows you to submit applications for metabolites of drugs that are already approved. There are some special aspects of that package … you’re allowed to reference the data with the primary drug, you’re typically allowed to do one instead of two controlled clinical trials, and you typically get 7 years of market exclusivity independent of your patent situation. So it’s a nice model and we’ve publicly said that this is our target. We’ve obviously not had conversations with the FDA about all of the aspects of our programs qualifying for 505(b)(2), but I mean I think that’s how I would answer that question.

\*\*What is 505(b)(2) ?\*\*

The 505(b)(2) New Drug Application (NDA) is a streamlined NDA process in which the applicant relies upon one or more investigations conducted by someone other than the applicant and for which the applicant has not obtained right of reference. In other words, the 505(b)(2) pathway enables investigators and/or manufacturers to apply for approval without having to repeat all the drug development work done for an innovator drug.

The US National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) has opened a probe into Tesla’s Autopilot software, citing the cars’ repeated collisions with parked emergency vehicles.

The NHTSA investigation will cover Tesla Models Y, X, S, and 3 vehicles released from 2014 through 2021. The federal agency says since 2018 it has logged 11 incidents (which include 17 injuries and one fatality) in which Tesla vehicles using the company’s Autopilot features, like Traffic-Aware Cruise Control, have crashed into stationary emergency vehicles. The agency says most of these incidents took place after dark, with the software ignoring scene control measures including warning lights, flares, cones, and an illuminated arrow board.

The investigation will “assess the technologies and methods used to monitor, assist, and enforce the driver’s engagement with the dynamic driving task during Autopilot operation,” according to NHTSA’s notes.

AN NHTSA SPOKESPERSON REMINDED THE PUBLIC THAT NO COMMERCIAL VEHICLES CAN DRIVE THEMSELVES
A spokesperson for the agency said that the investigation was in its preliminary stages and primarily concerned with uncovering additional information about the incidents. The spokesperson noted that the public should be aware that no commercially available cars are able to drive themselves, and vehicles always require a human in control at all times.

The inability of driving-assistance software from Tesla and other automakers to spot parked emergency vehicles is well known. Experts told Wired in 2018 that the likely cause is that these systems are programmed to mostly ignore stationary objects, otherwise they might react to all sorts of items on the side of roads, from signs to buildings.

Wired’s report notes that both Tesla and Volvo’s driving assist manuals warn drivers about this problem. As Tesla’s says: “Traffic-Aware Cruise Control cannot detect all objects and may not brake/decelerate for stationary vehicles, especially in situations when you are driving over 50 mph (80 km/h) and a vehicle you are following moves out of your driving path and a stationary vehicle or object is in front of you instead.”

The NHTSA has stepped up its scrutiny of Tesla in recent months as the company’s Autopilot software has been the focus of an increasing number of crashes. Many industry experts have criticized Tesla for its marketing of the software, which often suggests that human oversight of the vehicle is optional.

In April, senators urged the NHTSA to take “corrective actions” against Tesla and prevent misuse of its driving-assist software, and in June the agency issued new rules requiring companies like Tesla and Alphabet’s Waymo to report all incidents involving such systems.",1,US government opens probe into Tesla Autopilot crashes with emergency vehicles

frostybitz,"We've all made silly mistakes since our inception in the cryptoverse.

https://www.npr.org/2021/10/25/1048485043/irs-banks-taxes-fight-explainer



Obvious issues here:

*Violations of privacy. Like...holy shit GTFO and stop looking at my bank account Karen.

*Individuals *are not* the problem - corporations exploiting tax loopholes and tax havens are the real issue here. Unchecked power, etc.

*Forces people to use shady methods of concealing transactions. Obviously not an up and up thing, but also...Monero exists.

*This is absolutely an attack on crypto, but with a different approach than ""regulate"".


To that 4th point: There was a threshold amount of $600 that the treasury proposed:

There was massive backlash, so it was scaled up to $10,000.


But here is the reality we are all in:

If we cash out any crypto to a form of Fiat that has to go through a US bank account to clear that now gets slammed by the IRS. Now again, it's a near-0% chance you are audited (especially unelder $400k/yr income).


But say you made out amazingly well on something.

Say you dropped $10k into SHIB, and now you are up to $20k (it was up 99% for the year as of the other day IIRC). Maybe you YOLO'D into it with $50k or $100k, and now you cashed out and made $100k or $200k.

This gets painful as the numbers go up. And while I understand the average person here has sub $1k invested don't be fooled that this isn't a dig at lower income stuff.

Maybe you get WIC or food stamps or some type of supplemental income. Well suddenly the IRS sees your extra few grand distribution and now you get a letter telling you that you no longer qualify for that benefit. Puts a real damper on any future investing. Probably kills it for you outright or at least for a couple of years until you stabilize again.


This is another form of suppression plain and simple.

1. Cut toothpaste tube in half when it’s near empty. To get all the extra toothpaste stuck near the bottom and can now put toothpaste money towards tip. 

2. Do you know your paper towels can be dried and reused. Now you can save the fortune you would spend on paper towels and put it towards buying the Dip.

My personal fav:

3. Bidet; these can be bought fairly cheaply on Amazon, and over the years you would save a fortune since you no longer need to buy toilet paper. More money for dips and a cleaner bum sounds like a win.

I haven’t been able to send any of my coins to a different wallet for months now. I’ve successfully sent some coins to my Gemini wallet maybe 3-4 months ago but then out of nowhere I could only send a small amount (less than $100) and then a couple days later I couldn’t send anything. Now I when I try to send my coin to a different wallet I get a message on the bottom in red letters that says “Withdrawal amount too high. You currently may withdraw at most $77.83 (or equivalent), due to pending deposits. First of all, I have no pending deposits. Second, the amount they say I can withdraw up to changes every time I try to withdraw and is a random number like the one above (ex. $66.72, $200.87, $100.82, etc.). Not even every day, every single attempt I make it changes to a random number. Sometimes when the system gives me a higher amount like $100-$200 I try to send it to my Gemini wallet (because for specific coins you can only send it to a different wallet if you’re sending over a certain number—for example you can only send MATIC if you have 100+ coins) and then I get a pop up message that says “Transaction cannot be completed. Biometric verification failed.” 

I have seen many people on Twitter and Reddit going through similar issues with no response from AnchorUSD’s support team. They also have multiple complaints on BBB that are unresolved, and I saw someone’s email that they received from BBB after writing one:

“BBB has made several attempts to contact the business regarding the above referenced complaint. We regret to inform you that we have not received a response from the company. If you wish to purse this matter further you may want to contact the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.”

From what I’ve read AnchorUSD has only two employees which are the two CEOs of the company. It’s impossible to find any of their social medias or any useful information on them really. If you check their Twitter (which is the only social media platform they use) you can see they haven’t been active for months while people are begging for help. Some have been tweeting at them for MONTHS. At this point I’m convinced anyone who says they like AnchorUSD and haven’t experienced any problems with them are being paid to say so or something and the app is just a scam. I don’t know if those of us with money being held hostage by AnchorUSD need to get together and file a lawsuit or what but I’m not seeing enough people on here talking about this app screwing people over. I have over $4000 in my AnchorUSD account right now that they won’t let me move and it’s stressing me out immensely. That is a huge part of my life savings and it’s completely messed up that AnchorUSD is staying radio silent while holding people’s hard earned money.

DeliciousAd3885,"TradeStrike is excited to announce that we have integrated Chainlink Price Feeds into our upcoming DEX platform; TradeStrike Lite — on BSC. Chainlink will feed decentralized data feeds into our DEX dashboard, giving users real-time, and industry-leading benchmarks on various crypto-assets in order to make informed trading decisions. Our initial integration involves price feeds for BNB, BTC, USDT, BUSD, and LINK — with the ability to easily scale up to more assets in the future.

The integration marks the beginning of an ongoing commitment to exclusively use Chainlink Price Feeds across ALL of our upcoming products. As a next step, we plan to integrate Chainlink Price Feeds directly in our TradeStrike Wallet.

We selected Chainlink because it’s the most time-tested price feed solution in the industry, already helping secure tens of billions of dollars in value for leading decentralized and centralized financial products. Chainlink Price Feeds offer premium data quality with wide market coverage, as well as robust oracle infrastructure that maintains high uptime and tamper-resistance. By incorporating decentralized infrastructure like Chainlink, TradeStrike is able to offer increased transparency and reliability into the data relied on by traders while still maintaining strong precision and low update latency.

While our DEX will facilitate price discovery through spot markets, it’s important for users to have reliable benchmarks on assets as aggregated from across all exchanges. This will allow users to make even more precise decisions when trading as they can compare TradeStrike’s native DEX prices against the broader market.
After reviewing various centralized and decentralized data solutions, we found 
Chainlink Price Feeds to offer a superior solution, which uniquely combined accuracy, transparency, and robustness. Some of the key features of Chainlink Price Feeds:

High-Quality Data — Chainlink Price Feeds source data from numerous premium data aggregators, leading to price data that’s aggregated from hundreds of exchanges, weighted by volume, and cleaned from outliers and suspicious volumes. Chainlink’s data aggregation model generates more precise global market prices that are resistant to API downtime, flash crash outliers, and data manipulation attacks.

High Update Frequency — Chainlink Price Feeds on high-performance blockchains can perform frequent price updates at minimal costs, resulting in precise price data that consistently reflects current market conditions.
Robust Infrastructure — Chainlink Price Feeds utilize decentralized networks of professional node operators run by leading blockchain DevOps teams and traditional enterprises with a strong track record of uptime during market volatility.

Transparent Monitoring — Chainlink provides a robust reputation framework and set of on-chain monitoring tools that allow users to independently verify the historical and real-time performance of price feeds.

JizzelSweet,"Good day fellow crypto traders. 

I hope this post is not against certain guidelines and rules, I’m relatively new to the crypto market and just wanted to get an input from some of the more experienced people. 

I’ve recently got into a coin, which had at first glance, ample buy demand (thick buy wall) and relatively small sell wall. 

Got to admit got a bit of a FOMO at first and put in an order to a relatively high price. Bought it and was waiting for it to go up, which giving the relatively healthy buy order all, it did. 

Half a day later I began to notice that although ample volume of trading was being done, the price stayed barely above the price I bought it at and I would notice this glitch like in-and-out numbers in the order lists. I did some digging and learned about the whole spoofing phenomenon. Liceu and learn, right?

So my question to the more veteran traders here is - what is the best course of action when you see that the currency price is being spoofed for 2 days straight and the spoofing is done on both sides of the order book (on buy and sell)? Do you get out with the little gains or wait for the big play?

# What is it?

Theta represents a complex and extensive project associated with several purposes. The primary one, on which its business model is based, is about the structuring of a platform (precisely called Theta), able to offer video streaming services, exploiting the potential of the blockchain.  The streaming sector itself, as everyone knows, has been among the most developed markets over the last 5 years. The development of online platforms, centralized and headed by private organizations, has had the ability to revolutionize the world of visual entertainment.  In all this, Theta, through its technology, is trying to propose an alternative system, which we could define 4.0, completely decentralized, that is, based on the very presence of the network and on anyone willing to use the same services. Following are the main current issues that Theta is trying to solve:

* **Slow buffering**: centralized platforms, given the numerous overloads and considerable amounts of data, very often fail to offer clear and smooth resolutions and exposures. Theta aims to solve this through a process of sharing broadband power by interested users.
* **Lower costs**: centralized platforms, given the numerous costs to be incurred for infrastructures and so on, very often provide lower returns to content creators (the so-called streamers). The centralized nature of Theta aims to guarantee improvements also in this respect.
* **Rewards for everyone**: through the new generation Peer to Peer system, Theta aims to be able to offer to participants (i.e. those who make their power available to keep the system active) rewards in the form of tokens.

The video streaming sector, having as its main object providing content with a significant ""weight"", is associated with an enormous exchange of data. This aspect represented one of the first problems to be solved by the foundation at the head of the project. A second relevant aspect, present in this case due to the process of distribution of bonuses to those who participate in the provision of resources to keep the system active, concerns the amount (millions) of micropayments. How has Theta solved these aspects, allowing to structure a system of sharing, obtaining bandwidth and distribution of rewards? Through its internal structures based on:  Internal Theta network with node links and Theta blockchain.

* **Theta network**: the fundamental pillar concerns the internal network. It is a singular network, similar to a mesh network, which allows fast communication  between the nodes inside.  In turn, the internal communications of the nodes allow on the one hand to allow the collective system for making the band available (by users who decide to accept the process) and on the other to guarantee the maintenance of shares and visuals.  In other words, a single user, wishing to benefit from the service, can make part of his power available, in order to collaborate in the creation of the network of nodes, receiving in exchange tokens. A simple system in its complexity, to allow cost reductions (linked to traditional systems) and high quality video, linked to the nodes
* **Theta blockchain**: the Theta blockchain has been specially structured to meet the needs set out above, one of which is the immense amount of data to be managed. One of the first solutions, in this case in association with the problem of creating and structuring micropayments, concerns the Resource Oriented Micropayment Pool system.  Through it, it is possible to take advantage of the formation of very small off-chain payments, in turn associated with a network of withdrawals. The same technology has now opened the doors to new projects, all focused on the world of digitized payments.  Beyond micropayments, moving to data processing, the Theta organization had to look for a system to greatly increase the scope and capacity of the ecosystem (in other words, to continuously generate and ensure high throughput). To do this, it uses a Multi Level BTF (Byzantine Fault Tolerance) mechanism and a multi-layer system.

# Where to store it?

The best hot wallet for THETA are Theta Wallet, Trust Wallet and Atomic Wallet. If you want more security, a cold storage like Ledger or Trezor is the right choice.

sergelevrai5,"Hi everyone, so a thought occurred to me. We have $ backed stablecoin, gold and silver stablecoins on the way, but has anyone thought of creating a coin backed by actual real life land property?

The main advantage I see here is that land is actually of finite scarcity, on the contrary of $ (and gold on a smaller scale).

This is how I'm picturing it:
A fund buys a huge land property somewhere, for example 1M acres, and sells 1M token (1/acre) at double or triple the cost.
They have to sell it at a higher price, because the land needs investments in order to be managed in a sustainable and profitable way.

Then if you buy a token, part of this token represents the land and another part represents the capital linked to that land.

If the exploitation of the land earns money, it is added to the value
If the land value varies, it should also be reflected on the token price.

I feel this would be a safe haven in bear markets, plus it could be great for the planet's ecosystem if it's made properly, with a good governance system and sustainability as a core value.

If you want to trade i suggest only sell when you know your asset has pumped or take profits on the way up and when it drops significantly you buy back in.

Also remember when you do trade you need to keep track of your transactions for tax purposes it’s always safe to do bookkeeping.

Other than that if you take a look at previous bull runs and this one you can see just by holding even the low caps they slowly pull up as bitcoin goes sideways at times. These few months i think most things will move up regardless, it will take little % down but most will hold and move up as well.

kirtash93,"Welcome to **Round 33 of the Cryptotrivial 2021 contest**!

# Question 33: When the majority of peers on the network are malicious and monopolize the network in order to prevent specific nodes from receiving information from honest nodes. 

The correct answer of **Round 32** is...

# Bollinger Bands!

**What are Bollinger Bands:**

The Bollinger Bands, or BB, were developed in the 1980s by financial analyst and trader John Bollinger. Since then, many traders and chartists have been using the BB as a technical analysis (TA) indicator.In essence, the Bollinger Bands function as a measurement tool of market oscillations. As such, the BB indicator can be used to identify the moments that a particular market presents high or low volatility. Also, they can be useful for spotting potential overbought or oversold market conditions.

The BB indicator consists of two sidelong bands and a middle line. These three elements indicate how prices more around an average value, which is represented by the middle band. The upper and lower bands expand when market volatility is high, and contract when market volatility is low. They either move away from the middle band (high volatility) or towards it (low volatility).

The Bollinger Bands are among the most used TA indicators, especially in traditional financial markets. However, they are also used by cryptocurrency traders. Still, BB should not be used as a stand-alone tool but rather in conjunction with other TA tools and indicators, to decrease the overall risks.

There are a few basic ways of reading and interpreting the information provided by the BB indicator. 

For instance, imagine that the price of an asset moves from below the middle line all the way up to the upper band, surpassing it. This would indicate a potential overbought condition. The same reading logic applies to the opposite side. If an asset’s price exceeds the lower band, it may be indicative of oversold conditions. The upper and lower bands may also suggest potential support and resistance levels, in which the price is likely to bounce.

Other than that, the movement of the upper and lower bands in relation to the middle line is a very important factor of the BB indicator. The expansion and contraction of the bands may come handy when traders and chartists are trying to predict the next periods of market volatility (or lack thereof). 

For example, if the volatility starts increasing, the bands will expand and move away from the middle line. In contrast, if the market volatility decreases, the bands will contract and move towards the middle.

As most of you know SEC is the primary regulator of securities in the US and it will decide whether or not particular crypto is a security. Most of you may have heard of the so-called Howey test that SEC will employ to make this determination. However, the analysis that SEC will employ will go much deeper than that and will incorporate numerous important factors.

A body with SEC - the Strategic Hub for Innovation and Financial Technology (FinHub) coordinates the agency’s oversight and response regarding emerging technologies in financial, regulatory, and supervisory systems ie deals with crypto. FinHub serves as a public resource for information about the SEC’s views and actions related to FinTech innovation. Here is a link to the paper by FinHub that lays out the analytical framework of how SEC will evaluate if a cryptocurrency project is a security:

But the problem is that opensea can't see the ehtereum is that makes sense(i don't really know how to describe it) i've tried to relog and refresh the wallet but it still stays on no funds in opensea. My question is if the €50 i have in my account can't be used or can only be used for specific things, or if i can convert em so opensea will recognize is.",0,Different ethereum

From what I researched, Haven is a completely private wallet, with its own stable coin (xUSD). It is built based on Monero, including the bulletproofs. The protocol focuses on secure, private, and untraceable transactions. It uses THORchain to swap between different currencies. Haven protocol is similar to an offshore bank for the crypto space.

leo13mg,"  Hey guys,  
  Been keeping an eye on BTC lately, have done some analyses on it in the past weeks and now I have identified a different movement happening. This region is losing volume too fast and the players are not changing their position lately, this is dangerous because if a strong enough player acts it can drop the price suddenly! Check the graph:

[BTC has lost 60&amp;#37; of its volume since 21 of October and is back at 63K region, strong pressure region.](https://preview.redd.it/l6uwccdcwlv71.png?width=2557&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=136dc35515f4043d06068e06282852c5cd016021)

  As we can see this is a strong pressure region, acting more as a resistance, and the players are fighting around it. The MACD is stable showing that the buyers are not droping their position and the sellers have not yet attacked heavy the position, except for the 21 of Oct that sent the price back to 60K.

  
  T**he volume is dropping hard last days**, and that is the reason for this analysis, this region is a Pressure Region where big players tend to act heavy and the movements can swing fast, the coin has **lost 60% of its volume** since 21 of Oct and now is prone to Flash Crashes. Any whale can move the price easily now, any news can trigger a heavy movement.

  I have identified the region of 59K as a probably region to be hit by strong swing movements in price, those who are trading can put orders there in hopes to get a lucky movement, specially now that the price has hit 63K again. Its not a conventional trading strategy, more like a lucky shot to get 7% quickly if it happens. We are seeing many news of people getting great prices out off the price reach and is because of this low volume and players holding their region, any strong aggression can drive the price up or down fast. I wound't short this coin but don't FOMO if it hits 67K again, it can be one of these movements, be aware!

  What do you guys think about this region? is BTC getting enough momentum to break 63K for good?

Far-Pie-4360,"A popular crypto analyst and trader says Bitcoin may consolidate for some time while Ethereum leads an altcoin charge.

The pseudonymous analyst known as Inmortal tells his 92,000 Twitter followers that despite Bitcoin’s (BTC) recent correction from its all-time high of $67,276.79, he’s still not eager to buy dips in the king crypto.

According to the analyst, Bitcoin’s correction could take several weeks, all while other coins make new price spikes.

“BTC/USD

Price is below [the] old demand zone and currently testing weekly open as resistance.

If we go lower, the next interest area is $58,000 (untaken lows and KEY lvl), maybe a good spot to long, depends on the reaction.

Why I’m not buying dips aggressively? because I think BTC may consolidate below all-time high for a bit, then altcoin run, and weeks later another leg up for BTC. These are just my personal thoughts.

In any case, if BTC finds acceptance above $62,000 (weekly open and old demand) I think we could see a move up to $67,000.”

Inmortal has previously predicted that Ethereum will break out of an ascending channel en route to $6,300 by mid-November. 

According to Inmortal, the Ethereum rally will trigger other altcoins to follow suit.

3. You should HOPE that congress gets their shit together enough to actually tax the wealthy in a meaningful way. The reason you and I have to pay the amount of taxes that we do, is because the super-rich don't.   
4. Up until the mid-1980s, the highest tax bracket was 50%, 70%, even 91% at its peak. We are currently at 37% whether you make $1M or $100M.

* Current price seems to have found a home around $0.06 
* Current mc is $187M with a fully diluted mc of about $590M
* Coinbase listing
* They're a Singapore based crypto-fiat payment system similar to AMP (not a direct 1:1 comparison, as AMP is primarily collateral-fiat)
* Two big Q4 catalysts coming. One being a Binance listing (Binance is already currently a partner to Alchemy), the other being the launch of cytoplink cards with partnerships by VISA and Mastercard
* Building a payment bridge between crypto and fiat through binance Pay wallet, giving ACH holders access to Binance's huge base to send and receive global payments with over 40 different tokens, similar to Strike

The second one we’ll look at is **NKN**

* Currently sitting around $0.40
* About a $308M mc, fully diluted mc is under $500M
* No big vc firms behind it yet, giving higher potential gains to early investors
* If you watched Silicon Valley on HBO, NKN is basically a real-life Pied Piper
* If they can accomplish what they're after, it can be HUGE for NKN and the world, essentially allowing users to be their own telecom network
* Similar idea to a Helium network (but again, not a 1:1 comparison)
* Founder is Yanbo Li  who wrote core backbone for many projects (Zilliqa, Neo) and has a strong developer reputation, teamed up with Whitfield Diffie who is a cryptographer and pioneer of public-keys (winner of Turing award in 2015)

alexb_090,"As every crypto vet knows, the long term price action of crypto, and BTC in particular, has historically been controlled by the BTC halving cycle. For anyone who doesn't know, Bitcoin has a set reward paid out the successful miner of each block. 1 BTC block is mined approximately every 10 minutes. Originally, this reward was 50 BTC. However, every 120k blocks, or about every 4 years, the reward is halved. There have been 3 halvings so far, as can be seen in [this chart](https://masterthecrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/bitcoin-halving-price-usd-exchange-rate-values.jpg). Currently, the block reward is 6.25 BTC.

&amp;#x200B;

The most important thing to note about the chart is that shortly before a halving and then for a long time after, there has consistently been a huge bull market, followed by a bear market, and then a consolidation and accumulation period before the next halving and bull market. Again, every vet should recognize this, but many newbies won't. Although no one is completely sure, these halvings are believed to impact the price of BTC in this way due to the laws of supply and demand. During a halving event, the inflation rate dramatically shrinks and the miners (who presumably own a large percentage of the supply) have a shift in their economic incentives due to the anticipation of smaller supply.

&amp;#x200B;

Now, as you can also see in the chart linked above, each consecutive bull market has been longer and caused a smaller rise in price. This is because each halving has less of an effect on the price. [Here](https://cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/coindesk/VIQLRRLMWZCNXLSAI6AOWE4N4A.png) is a chart showing the total supply and block rewards over time. In the first halving in 2012, with a supply of around 10.5 million BTC, the block reward dropped from 50 to 25 resulting in a daily supply growth change from 7200 BTC to 3600 BTC or a yearly inflation rate drop from 25% to 12.5% overnight. This inflation change is clearly hugely significant. However, the next inflation drop was less significant, from  8.2% to 4.1%, with the most recent one being less significant than that, from 3.5% to 1.75%.

&amp;#x200B;

The lessening impact of these inflation adjustments during halvings combined with the trend of crypto whales being more institutional investors and less miners has been and will continue to lead to the end of BTC cycles. The one we are currently experiencing has already bounced some previous trends with this double peak, and although I am still expecting a dip soon, it will probably be the last clear cycle with an obviously parabolic bull market and a long, cold winter after.

&amp;#x200B;

In terms of what you should take away from this, you should realize that we aren't early anymore. The market is on its way to stabilizing, and although the ordinary American still isn't invested, all the institutions are at least exposed in some way. However, this is still bullish. Stability is attractive and leads to mass adoption, and big gains can still come from new altcoins because although the market is no longer new, much of the tech is. It also means that if/when the next crypto dip comes, it may be your last chance to load up on the big boys at a ""low"" price. I know this has been kind of a wall of text, but I hope it helps someone.",0,Bitcoin halving cycles and why they mean less and less.

vaibhav_k_garg,"I am a few months into crypto and still a noob. I did not understand impermanent loss before i put it most of my spot balances into Liquid Swap to earn interest, as apposed to hodeling thru the recent price crash. 

I can now see that the my coins are getting weighed towards the less profitable ones. Eg, 

  **2021-09-25** \- LTC/BTC - Added Liquidity            - 1.1065 LTC + 0.0040 BTC - **341.1722 USD** 

but today, while reviewing it shows current standing as:

   **2021-10-25** \- LTC/BTC - Current Composition - 1.1939 LTC + 0.0037 BTC  -  **467.6662 USD**

So even thought the total value has gone up from 341USD  to 467USD as price has increased (mainly for BTC), it would have been higher if I had never added to liquidity. 

NOW, I am truly appreciating impermanent loss, which is actually permanent loss as my LTC holding has increased and BTC reduced. It basically seems that added liquidity will always shift towards lesser performing coin and may come back if that other coin starts going up compared to its pair.

**TL;DR;** I added to Liquidity Swap in Binance Liquidity swap without properly understanding impermanent loss. Now I have more of low performing coins and less of high performing coins. I am about to remove all funds from liquidity and looking for any advise.

[Mastercard Inc.](https://www.bloomberg.com/quote/MA:US) is making it easier for banks to offer cryptocurrency rewards on their credit and debit cards as part of the payment network’s recent embrace of digital currencies. 

To pull it off, Mastercard has inked a deal with [Bakkt](https://www.bloomberg.com/quote/BKKT:US), the cryptocurrencies firm that spun off from Intercontinental Exchange earlier this year, according to a [statement](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/terminal/R1JC60MEQTXF) Monday. As part of the changes, Mastercard will also make it easier for consumers to spend the cryptocurrency rewards they earn at the millions of retailers on the firm’s network. 

“Together with Bakkt and grounded by our principled approach to innovation, we’ll not only empower our partners to offer a dynamic mix of digital assets options, but also deliver differentiated and relevant consumer experiences,” Sherri Haymond, executive vice president of digital partnerships at Mastercard, said in the statement. 

CNBC reported the partnership earlier Monday. Bakkt shares surged 40% to $12.78 at 9:33 a.m. in New York. Mastercard shares climbed 1.2%. 

Mastercard said earlier this year it would begin allowing cardholders to transact in certain cryptocurrencies on its network. In July, the payments giant said it would work with startups focused on crypto and digital assets as part of its push to make it easier for consumers to buy, spend and hold cryptocurrencies.

Between launch in August 2020 &amp; the new ATH yesterday, SHIB is up by **4 418 400%. That's how much you would have if you've invested 100$ back then.**

thirdworlddude,"Around May 2019, I spent AUD 1300 to buy 13 random Altcoins. I remember buying **33.74 BNB** first with the money. I bought 13 coins assigning a certain amount to each one of them. I picked the coins randomly. Most of them were pumped here in the last bull run. They still existed so I bought them because I was familiar with their name. I didn't do any further research. I know it was not a good strategy but I took the risk.

Here is my calculations and how much my portfolio is worth today.

&amp;#x200B;

|Coin|Quantity|Total Cost (AUD)|Worth Today (AUD)|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|Siacoin|20000|100|500|
|Icon|171.3|100|482|
|MIOTA|168.9|100|299|
|ARK|113.5|100|303|

|WXT|18153|200|144|
|FTM|2736.78|135.78|10948|
|||1300 AUD|14783 AUD|

I remember reading here that buying BTC wouldn't be worth it because someone commented something along the lines of, ""Meh, how much will BTC go up by now, it's already worth so much."" So, I showed less interest in BTC.

If I had spent the entire money (1300 AUD) on Bitcoin, I would have approximately 0.154 BTC which would be worth 12,975 AUD approx today. BTC was around 7K USD and 9K AUD back then.

If I had spent the entire money on ETH I would have 21500 AUD worth of Ethereum.

Had I not exchanged my 33.74 BNB to these Alts, it would be worth **21,854 AUD** today.

I got lucky with the last coin FTM which covered a good portion of my BNB opportunity costs. I bought it by mistake thinking that I was buying Feathercoin about which I heard in a movie.

There were a lot of ups and downs from back then to today. I remember thinking I should have bought a Macbook instead because I had a shitty laptop which I'm using to type this today as well.

Anyways, the lesson I learned was not to invest randomly because you might not always get lucky. Invest in good projects instead.

Numbers: Shiba Inu’s price reached $0.000044, which is an increase of 39,000,000% in the past year.

Background: Shiba Inu is known as the Dogecoin killer and is now seen as the dominant meme coin in the market.

Catalyst: The price of Shiba Inu increased Sunday due largely to a tweet that suggested that Robinhood (Nasdaq: HOOD) might list the crypto on its platform soon. There is already a petition with over 300,000 signatures from people asking Robinhood to list the coin.

TheBlueMango01,"TLDR: inflation and energy costs are going to hurt crypto mining and households will probably lack liquidity, so we might look at a potential sell-off in the winter, before we finally finish this cycle next year.

&amp;#x200B;

I am overall seeing a fairly positive outlook for crypto in the next few months, but while I think November should be a great month for crypto, I think there is cause for concern for the upcoming winter. I'm not here to spread FUD, just trying to remain level headed and realistic, and that's why I've added in my sources. Please do comment below your opinion on this.

I think before I give a bit of a road map for where I think bitcoin is headed, let's review the current economic situation.

**Inflation:**

Inflation has already been drastically increasing in the west especially with the current limitations of the supply chains, and the quantitative easing due to corona. More money being thrown in, means higher demand, and therefore prices and add on top what is now being termed: ""the great resignation"", where in September alone more that 4.3 Americans resigned from their jobs, you get inflation, leading to companies working understaffed, you get inflation.

**Rising energy prices:**

Energy. Today we are reliant on electricity for everything we do. From mining bitcoin to calling your loved one, to working. However last year's very cold winter, and the COVID pandemic meant that a lot of the energy companies used up their stocks of oil, gas and coal, and most importantly DID NOT REPLENISH THEM THIS PAST YEAR DUE TO LACK OF INVESTMENT UNDER COVID. This means today we are faced with a situation, where with the economy kickstarting back to life, the demand for electricity and energy products in general is soaring but the supply cannot follow. This means higher energy prices, which will not get any better in the winter due to even higher demands. In an other situation, local governments could forcibly cut the electricity at some points during the day or to specific less ""economically valuable"" sectors.

\[Hidden Bitcoin Risk?\]([https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rex-h4vkELs&amp;ab\_channel=CoinBureau](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rex-h4vkELs&amp;ab_channel=CoinBureau))

**How does this affect crypto?**

Boy oh boy, in so many ways... First and foremost, let's talk mining. Please bear in mind I am no expert on this matter, and if someone wants to complement what i say in the comments, please do feel free! Anyway, mining today requires of course energy to find that famous 60 digit (?) number needed to mine a block. With energy prices soaring, this could lead to a lot of companies first and foremost stopping mining bitcoin because it isn't profitable anymore, or even forcibly being cut off from electricity due to the lack of ""economic value"" that is perceived to be created from bitcoin. This will drop the hash rate, and make processing transactions slower, probably deterring new investors from coming in. Then with the situation of inflation and the energy crisis, well, it will probably lead to households lacking liquidity in the short term until the government can put in place some contractionary policies, and until the winter is over, and thus the demand for energy products lowers. Needing more liquidity, will mean taking money out of investments, crypto will inevitably be included.

&amp;#x200B;

Knowing this, we have to turn to some bitcoin analysis because anyway we know that it will dictate what the asset class does. There are different theories as of now on the direction for bitcoin in the upcoming few months, but the main theory is that the market cycle is not in. Moreover, some analysts have noticed the similarities between the 2013-14 market cycle and the current one. But basically the general consensus seems to be a double peak cycle like the aforementioned one. The key difference in consensus is for example CryptoCrewUniversity  saying the market cycle top could come this upcoming month, and Benjamin Cowen talking about a much longer market cycle that could extend into next year.

\[Bitcoin price prediction - CryptoCrewUniversity\]([https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wECZvQ5twzc&amp;t=3s&amp;ab\_channel=CryptoCrewUniversity](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wECZvQ5twzc&amp;t=3s&amp;ab_channel=CryptoCrewUniversity))

I would like to therefore propose a theory that would take into consideration all of the aforementioned information and merge it into one.

Bitcoin price over the next few months would look something like this:

&amp;#x200B;

[\*\*POTENTIAL\*\* Bitcoin price action in the next 9 months](https://preview.redd.it/lgar0l6lnlv71.png?width=1813&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e62c237ae5990f955dc6bc2957b45aafe97d2f88)

I would like to propose the triple cycle top theory. Let me explain it.

First and foremost, we take from CryptoCrewUniversity's theory that the market cycle top is going to come in in November, however, I will argue that we will get rejected before reaching it by the same bitcoin logarithmic growth band as in April this year (which would then be at 100k, a level which anyway could provide resistance since it is a massive milestone). This would be the second peak. Such a rejection would also be fuelled by the inflation and the energy crisis that is inevitable, and could cause a drop until basically 40k in my opinion. This level would correlate with both the logarithmic band that held as support in July and is the level we held support at in September before we went on the current move to 69k (nice.) . Anyway that would probably mean that in early March the situation might slowly start to clear up with lower demand for energy coming out of the winter and the governments finding solutions to the inflation. We could then finally do another repeat of the move in august to now, with the same move to the middle log band, down to the bull market support band, and then finally the final rally to 150k and above, being the third and final peak, which could correlate then with the longer market cycle theory put forward by Benjamin Cowen.

Of course I'm obviously an ape who doesn't know shit about fuck so please don't take this for God's word, I'm just trying to come up with a reasonable prediction for shits and giggles. Of course this is only for educational purposes and not financial advice. Please write down why I may be wrong.

1. Provide donations/charity to local community programs where we can supply food and host pop up kitchens to provide food to the people in need. 
2. Help aspiring cooks, pastry chefs, sommeliers, to get scholarships for ACF certifications and som certifications. 
3. Help burnt out Restaurnt workers by providing them services such as addiction help centers, consulting services, counseling services.

WorkerBee-3,"#The written Constitution itself, along with the Amendments, is the distributed ledger. And Congress, along with the President, is suppose to be the way we all come to consensus. 

How does this work? 

Well in America the 3 branches of government; Legislative, Executive, and Judicial are all supposed to be separated in efforts to point the power towards the people. 

How do the people get power under this constructed system? 

Well, it comes down to how we vote. 

Take political parties out of the equation and follow how the system was written. 

#Article 1: Congress. House of Representatives &amp; the Senate. 

In the constitution each and every State gets their equal representation by having 2 Senetors each as well as a population sized amount of House members. 

Based on general living conditions each state should be electing officials who represent the state's environment. Officials who know what it's like to live in dessert, mountains, the plains, off the ocean, surrounded by lakes, or even swamp/marshy land. And they not only would know what it's like to live in these areas but they should know what laws are best needed for these areas and what laws would hurt those who live in these areas. 

So you get 2 Senetors from each environment and a population sized House members from each environment. Chosen by the people who live in those environments. 

Clear distributed representation from across the entire country. 

#Article 2: The Executive Branch. 

The executive branch, referring to the President and his team of operations, is elected by the country as a whole. All environment landscapes and life styles, city/non-city, vote and the best outcome is suppose to be someone who represents what unifying perspectives are needed across each and every single environment to the best of a full countries abilities to vote. 

If any State feels the President doesn't represent them, well power is split between the branches and they still hold members who represent them in the Legislative Branch which is designed to keep the power of the Executive branch in check. By design, Their Representatives can still tell the President when he's not fulfilling the needs of the full country. 

#Article 3: The Judicial Branch 

How is this branch elected? Well this branch has members who are nominated by the Executive branch (as a country, we pick the person who picks these people) and then those nominations are voted on and approved by the Congress (as individual States, we pick the people who approve these nominations) 

Those who get nominated by the country's thinking (because the president is suppose to represent our thinking as a whole) and then approved by the States thinking (because Congress members are suppose to represent each State's way of thinking) are then in charge of making sure we all follow the rules written up by our voted members of Government. Not only are they in charge of that but they are in charge of reading the Constitution and making sure that the voters/citizens don't have any of their inalienable rights infringed upon during the law making consensus. (Our soul rights of; Life, Liberty, and the Pursuit of Happiness) 

The Judicial branch is designed to keep both the 1st and 2nd branches of government in check so that they don't infringe on the voters rights. They are our final form of protection. 

This is a 200 year old decentralized structure. And this is how consensus was reached before computers.


#This is how the system is designed. 

Political parties are not apart of that original structure and actually compromise the separation between the branches of government. We no longer have 3 separated branches of government because we have both Republicans all across each branch and Democrats all across each branch. 

If you know anything about mining Bitcoin, you would know it is designed in a way that is decentralized. Meaning no one entity controls Bitcoin. It reaches consensus by the globe as a whole. But there is this point of failure called the 51% attack. Because of the price of Bitcoin, the only realistic way for this to happen would be from large mining pools where people join a group to mine and distribute the rewards across the pool when blocks are mined. 

Mining pools = Political Parties (voting pools) 

Political parties are where people join together in big groups to win the seats and then distribute the ""rewards"" (of being able to write laws) across each and every member of that pool. 

The problem with voting pools is they can cause the same 51% attack to the Decentralized Constitution as mining pools can cause to Decentralized Bitcoin. 

Having one pool in all 3 branches of government means there is no longer a separate of power between these branches and that means that the voters no longer have power. The system is compromised. 

The fact that 2 pools are saturated across the 3 branches of Government, and both parties spend a lot of time attacking each other, this country is constantly under a 51% attack. Whichever pool wins majority those years, they have 51%+ control over the consensus and they ""attack"" the other pool instead of voting based off environmental wants and needs like the original design. 

#This country needs to recognize that Political Parties compromise the structure of the Constitution. 

That is all I have to share, thank you for reading this if you did.",0,The US Constitution is a Decentralized structure. (And political parties are ruining it)

InvMiqx,"When I see people debating between cryptocurrencies and fiat money, I'll hear them mention decentralization, anonymity, low fees, etc. I almost never see discussion about what, in my opinion, truly makes cryptocurrencies special.

Cryptocurrencies are community-driven and open-source. Anyone can innovate upon cryptocurrencies, while comparatively, it is almost impossible for just anyone to innovate upon fiat currencies. 

If you weren't previously aware, Ethereum is moving from proof-of-stake to proof-of-work. This will entail massive changes.

I have seen endless debate regarding this change. But one thing I think that people are missing is that this is innovation. Yes, billions of dollars in asset value are on the line. Regardless of the financial outcome, the community will learn something from this transition, and we'll make future innovations having learned from its successes or its failures.  

Sometimes, innovation takes risk-taking. Investing in Ethereum is by in part investing in the community's ability to innovation. I'm more than okay with this.

A little exaggerated, right? And seeing all the attention it has gained lately –and all those ATMs– I think crypto is gonna be a popular gift this Christmas season. It’s like getting money from gramma, but better than money. And if you’re the giver, you’re definitely not gonna look like a gramma.

This year there is an announced supply chain shortage, added to a shipping crisis which might leave a lot of people with their hands empty in the very last minute. So imagine you slept on and forgot to buy some important gifts… It is December 15 and probability is you won’t be able to get them on time. What do you do? Reach for your wallet.

If this happens, not only will people not cash out (just pass on their coins) but there might also be a nice inflow to the crypto market, which might push our expectations of a bear market from December further to January. And yet another reason is that a workers in many countries get an additional paycheck in the end of the year which I would be willing to spend on nothing else but coins sweet coins.

***Full blog post with all the tables*** [***here***](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2021-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-9)***.***

January 1st, 2021, I bought $100 of following and turned it into a homemade crypto index fund: **Bitcoin, Ethereum, Tether, XRP, Litecoin, Polkadot, Bitcoin Cash, Cardano, Binance Coin,** and **Chainlink.** Below is the ninth monthly update on the progress of the 2021 Experiment.

***tl;dr:***

* **What's this all about?** Back in January 2018, I made a homemade crypto Index Fund, purchasing $100 of each of the Top 10. Crypto winter started immediately after, but I haven't sold or traded and have been reporting monthly ever since. I repeated the Experiment 2019, 2020, and 2021 because I'm a glutton for punishment and to show different entry points. ***Learn more about the history and rules of the Experiments (including why in the world I would include Tether)*** [***here***](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/about/)***.***
* **SEP Winner** \- All-red month. Stablecoin **USDT** remained, um, stable, and **DOT** only fell -2%.
* **Overall since Jan. 2021** \- **ADA** in lead followed closely by **BNB. 100%**  of cryptos in green, **LTC** last place in 2021
* **2018+2019+2020+2021 Combined Top Ten Portfolios are returning 405%.**

## Month Nine – UP 333%

*Processing img 66veem3qilv71...*

The 2021 Top Ten Crypto Index Fund consists of: **BTC, ETH, USDT, XRP, Litecoin, DOT, BCH, ADA, BNB,** and **LINK**.  

September highlights for the 2021 Top Ten Portfolio: 

* Following its first all green month since [February 2021](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2021-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-2), the portfolio finished the month 100% in the red
* **ADA** retains the lead, but second place **BNB** makes up ground in September.

## September Movement Report, Ranking, and Dropouts

Surprisingly, there wasn’t much movement this month with the 2021 Top Ten:

Downs:

* **Bitcoin Cash** – down 4 places (#14–&gt;#18)
* **Chainlink** – down 3 places (#12–&gt;#15)

*Processing img ij8g140tilv71...*

**Top Ten dropouts since January 2021:**  Nine months into the 2021 Top Ten Experiment, three cryptos have dropped out: **Chainlink, Litecoin,** and **Bitcoin Cash.**  They have been replaced by **SOL**, **DOGE,** and **USDC**.

## September Winners and Losers

***September Winners*** –  Besides **Tether**, **DOT** had the least bad month, finishing September down only -2%.

***September Losers*** –  All coins were in the red, but **ADA** had the worst month, losing -26%.

**Tally of Monthly Winners and Losers**

Nine months into the Experiment, here’s where we stand in terms of the 2021 Top Ten Portfolio’s monthly winners and losers: 

*Processing img qqv3fd8uilv71...*

**ADA** is in the lead with three monthly victories.  **ADA** is also tied with **UST** for most losses.  Swing trade anyone?

## Overall Update – ADA in front, BNB in second place, all cryptos in green.

Despite a tough September, **Cardano** has managed to maintain its lead over **Binance Coin**, preventing yet another flip for first place.  Both cryptos have had a very strong 2021 up +1,144 and +976% respectively.

The $100 investment into first place **ADA** nine months ago is now worth **$1,243.**

Besides **Tether**, **Litecoin** is the worst performing cryptocurrency of the 2021 Top Ten Portfolio, up only **+29%** in 2021. 

## Total Market Cap for the Entire Cryptocurrency Sector:

The total crypto market lost about $108B in September, settling at just over $2.1T.  As a sector, crypto is up **+173%** in the nine month lifespan of the 2021 Top Ten Experiment. 

You may notice that the 2021 Top Ten Portfolio is returning a little over double the overall crypto market cap (+333% vs. +173%) so far in 2021.  

This is a bit of an outlier: the rest of the [Top Ten Experiments](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/) are well behind what the overall market has returned in their respective time frames.  Although the 2021 Top Ten approach has held up quite well compared to the overall market so far, I expect to see it fall behind eventually, like the other experiments.

Crypto Market Cap Low Point in the 2021 Top Ten Crypto Index Experiment: [**$775B in January 2021**](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2021-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-1/).

Crypto Market Cap High Point in the 2021 Top Ten Crypto Index Experiment: **$2.22T** [**last month**](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2021-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-8).

## Bitcoin Dominance:

*Processing img ypp5luqvilv71...*

**BitDom** bounced slightly in September, up to 43.2% compared to 42% in August.  This is still at the low end of the range when looking at the 2021 timeframe as a whole. 

BitDom Low Point in the 2021 Top Ten Crypto Index Experiment: [**41.9% in May 2021**](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2021-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-5/).

BitDom High Point in the 2020 Top Ten Crypto Index Experiment: [**70.4% in  January 2021**](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2021-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-1/).

## Overall return on $1,000 investment since January 1st, 2021:

*Processing img 8qiyl9ywilv71...*

The 2021 Portfolio lost nearly $894 in August.  Overall, the 2021 Top Ten Portfolio is up +333%, the initial $1000 investment on New Year’s Day 2021 worth **$4,330**. 

Here’s the month by month ROI of the 2021 Top Ten Experiment, to give you a sense of perspective and provide an overview as we go along:

*Processing img 358kb42yilv71...*

The 2021 Top Ten Portfolio has had the best start, by far, of any of the four [Top Ten Crypto Experiments](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/).  

## Combining the 2018, 2019, 2020, and 2021 Top Ten Crypto Portfolios 

As most readers are aware, this is the fourth year of an Experiment I started back in January of 2018, [at the height of the last crypto bull run](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2018-top-ten-month-one/).  Where do we stand if we combine four years of the Top Ten Crypto Index Fund Experiments?

* [2018 Top Ten Experiment](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2018-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-45): up +46% (total value $1,460)
* [2019 Top Ten Experiment](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2019-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-33): up +510% (total value $6,098)
* [2020 Top Ten Experiment](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2020-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-21): up +731% (total value $8,309)
* [2021 Top Ten Experiment](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2021-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-9): up +333% (total value $4,330)

Taking the four portfolios together, here’s the bottom bottom bottom *bottom* line: 

**After a $4,000 investment in the 2018, 2019, 2020, and 2021 Top Ten Cryptocurrencies,** the combined portfolios are worth **$20,197** ($1,460 + $6,098 + $8,309 + $4,330).

**That’s up +405%** when you put all four Top Tens together.

Here’s a table to help visualize the progress of the combined portfolios:

*Processing img gqqp5ll1jlv71...*

***That’s a +405% gain by investing $1k into the cryptos that happened to be in the Top Ten on January 1st, 2018, 2019, 2020, and 2021.***

## Comparison to S&amp;P 500

I’m also tracking the S&amp;P 500 as part of my experiment to have a comparison point to traditional markets. For the first time in nearly a year, the S&amp;P 500 did not reach another month end all time high in September:

*Processing img mz2wxer6jlv71...*

The S&amp;P 500 Index is up **16%** in 2021.  The initial $1k investment I put into crypto nine months ago would be worth **$1,160** had it been redirected to the S&amp;P 500.

The 2021 Top Ten Crypto Portfolio is up **+333%** over the same time period – the initial $1k investment in crypto nine months ago is now worth **$4,330**.

That’s a difference of **$3,170** on a $1k investment in nine months.

What about in the longer term? What if I invested in the S&amp;P 500 the same way I did during the first four years of the Top Ten Crypto Index Fund Experiments? What I like to call the world’s slowest dollar cost averaging method?  Here are the figures:

* $1000 investment in S&amp;P 500 on January 1st, 2018 = $1,630 today
* $1000 investment in S&amp;P 500 on January 1st, 2019 = $1,740 today
* $1000 investment in S&amp;P 500 on January 1st, 2020 = $1,350 today
* $1000 investment in S&amp;P 500 on January 1st, 2021 = $1,160 today

Taken together, here’s the bottom bottom bottom *bottom* line for a similar approach with the S&amp;P: 

**After four $1,000 investments into an S&amp;P 500 index fund in January 2018, 2019, 2020, and 2021, my portfolio would be worth $5,880** ($1,630 + $1,740 + $1,350 + $1,160)

That’s up **+47%** [since January 2018](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2018-top-ten-month-one/) compared to a **+405%** gain of the combined Top Ten Crypto Experiment Portfolios, a difference of 358% ***in favor of crypto.***

To help provide perspective, here’s a quick look at the combined four year ROI for crypto vs. the S&amp;P up to this point.

*Processing img xwtbhzp9jlv71...*

## Conclusion:

The 2021 Top Ten Crypto Portfolio is up **+333%** since the beginning of the year and the only Top Ten Portfolio to outperform the overall market.  Q3 is historically a down month for crypto – how high can this portfolio reach by the end of the year?

To the long time followers of the Top Ten Experiments, thank you so much for sticking around so long. For those just getting into crypto, I hope these reports will help prepare you for the highs and lows that await on your crypto adventures.  Buckle up, go with the flow, think long term, don’t invest what you can’t afford to lose, and most importantly, try to enjoy the ride!  Feel free to reach out with any questions and stay tuned for progress reports.

That rise was accompanied by Elon Musk tweeting about dogecoin (DOGE) again. Dogecoin already rose several times this year unprecedentedly hard after Musk's tweets and this time the DOGE and SHIB prices got another boost from Musk. SHIB also rose hard early this month after a tweet from Musk.

However, then the billionaire threw a spanner in the works for SHIB fans. He made it clear last night, around the time the SHIB price peaked, that he is a dogecoin fan and not a shiba inu fan. He denied that he owns SHIB at all:

Then the SHIB price plunged sharply to $0.00003542, down 20%. The huge volume that coincided with SHIB's rise then partially spilled over to dogecoin, which then rose briefly. The Tesla CEO then reported that the only crypto he owns are bitcoin (BTC), ethereum (ETH) and dogecoin:

In particular, the policies of central banks around the world had to take umbrage. ""You should just buy bitcoin alone,"" he joked to the audience in Miami. In which he winked at bitcoin maximalists who generally have their entire wealth in bitcoin.

&amp;#x200B;

**Why did Thiel hesitate to buy more bitcoin?**

***The only thing Peter Thiel currently seems to regret is not buying more bitcoin earlier***. ""I feel like I haven't invested enough in bitcoin,"" the billionaire said. The reason he did not invest more is because he had the belief that ""the secret"" was already known to everyone. By which he means that he thought everyone with a little money had long understood bitcoin.

&amp;#x200B;

The current price explosion proves otherwise and Peter Thiel sees that too. ""I think more buying is still the best strategy. Maybe it's still enough of a secret,"" Thiel continued. The co-founder of PayPal seems almost unable to believe that not everyone has already figured out the value of bitcoin in the current macroeconomic climate.

&amp;#x200B;

Known as a libertarian, Thiel sees the rise of bitcoin as the world's answer to the current financial system that is squeaking and creaking on all sides. ""Is bitcoin going to rise beyond $66,000? It could, but it certainly shows that it we've arrived at the complete bankruptcy of central banks,"" Thiel reveals in no uncertain terms.",0,"German-American billionaire, Peter Thiel, regrets not buying more bitcoin earlier, he is one of us"
Expert_Opening543,"I threw a small amount of money at crypto in 2018 and didn't do anything else until last year. Then I started putting  small chunks of money in whenever I felt like it. In 2021 I started DCA every week so im finally getting excited and watching it climb.

I see people talk about if you put 1000 into bitcoij 10 years ago you would have 15 million ( or whatever it is now). But the point in making , or asking rather , is do you have a specific strategy to sell? I find it hard to believe that the people that started very early didn't sell WAY earlier than they would of liked. Because BTC at 5000 seemed crazy, they probably would of never believed 50,000. 

I obviously don't plan on holding forever because what's the point of investing all of this if you don't get to enjoy it but do you sell a certain percentage when the market goes up or down say 10 percent? 

I started DCA because I found that I wasn't disciplined enough to try to time the market. Too many doubts on if this was the bottom or top. 

Is whale watching a proven strategy? If you watch when the big holders buy and sell is that worth it?

belsaurn,"I keep seeing people talk about if this happens or that happens regulation wise, that people would just put their profits into XMR or another privacy coin, or ""lose"" it in a boating accident to avoid taxes or regulations on it.

I would really like to know how you think that would avoid the government knowing about it or trying to tax you on it, and what good it would actually do you?

Lets say for example you moved all your crypto to XMR to avoid taxes on it. How would that hide it? You had to buy it some way, whether that is through an exchange, a dex or P2P, there would be a trail right up to you receiving the XMR. Sure they can't tell what you did with it after, but they would know you have it.

Now the boating accident situation, would losing your crypto make it be forgiven by the tax man? I know if you keep cash and your house burns down, you are still liable for the taxes you owe earning that cash no matter that it burnt. So how would ""losing"" it in a boating accident be any different?

Lastly, lets say you did manage to conceal it in XMR or convince the tax man you shouldn't pay tax on crypto you lost. What could you do with it then? If you want to spend it right now, you would have to be able to convert it to fiat at some point, meaning it would once again be traceable. So how would that actually work?",0,"Taxes, XMR and Boating Accidents"

undevy,"&gt;**TL;DR**: It’s really fun to make money. But, you know what’s even more fun? Using crypto profits to take care of your mental health and well-being. Doing this will make you a better person for yourself, your family, and everyone you meet.

Since so many all-time highs have been reached lately, and a lot of our portfolios are in green, it is important to recognize that we are in a bull market at this point. **It won't last forever**, and it may not even last till the end of the year, so it is an interesting exercise to think about where all this is going.

Putting this post together is about how to step back from crypto psychologically. There isn't the best moment to do so, but **exiting with profits could be the most important step of your life**. Speaking from my own experience, by no means do I intend to give financial advice.

If you've been in this sub for a long time now, you can feel the greed and euphoria of every single market rise. The topic of taking your profits and DCA out has been discussed a lot recently. However, **we don't tackle enough the subject of what we should do next** when the profits aren't on paper but in our bank accounts.

Because the crypto market can go up and down in an instant, when you're in the green, it is important to appreciate that you reach your goals on time. We all know the HODL mantra, and having a lot of crypto in your portfolio is still a smart move, but you should also take advantage of bull markets to do good in the world.

**Are you really going to look at the charts every day until you die?** Cryptocurrencies should not become a source of dopamine for you. The world is a beautiful place, and you no doubt have a place in it. Remember that crypto is not our ultimate goal, and if we haven't learned by now, crypto won't make us happy. **If you look at your life after you've made a lot of money, it's easy to see that you're still the same person.** If you're happy, you're happy; if you're unhappy, you're unhappy. If you're only in it for the money, likely, you won't find any meaning or fulfillment.

Think about what you want in life, and do not focus on ""getting rich fast"", **focus on your deepest desires**. Use your profit as a tool to improve your life, by traveling, buying a new house, starting a business, paying off debt, or just enjoying life. The list of things that will bring genuine happiness is endless. Having never been happy in my life, I always assumed the reason was lack of money, but I realized that good profits could solve my money problems, but they definitely don't solve all my problems.

To be genuinely happy, I had to take responsibility for my mental health. I used some of my profits to focus on it and started feeling exponentially better. To be genuinely happy used to seem impossible to me, but boy, I have never been so wrong in my life! I am now happier than ever, and it feels incredible.

**Self-improvement is the most effective way to make the world a better place.** You don't have to be a narcissistic asshole, all you need to do is practice self-care and care for the people around you. You should never forget that the profits from selling parts of your crypto portfolio may help you live the life you really want.",0,Crypto won’t make you happy. It never could. Use your profit to care for yourself. Use crypto profits to get a better life for you and the people around you.

HiddenknifeX,"BTC went from 66 to high 59 yesterday and decided to take some profit on 3
coins which i had profit on and was relatively happy with how much i made. Thing is that everytime a dip came it cought me off guard reducing my profit to almost 0 or even creating minuses on my overall portofolio. That thing kept my money blocked for days or even months without being able to do anything just stare at numbers going low. The assets i sold represent like 50% of the portofolio, leaving behind only assets on which i have low profit or ""-"". 

I usually watch a few indicators that i guess showed me that BTC might dump a few ""k's"" if it reaches 59 since theres not so many orders between ~60 - 55. VPVR &amp; MACD (1D) . 

Now that i sold, BTC rose again and now i am pulled out of those assets on which i could have gotten bigger profit now, but at the same time the price could have gone south. Never know.

Lexikov,"Have any of you heard or invested in FEG yet?

Looks quite promising as a project, with good fundamentals and a bright roadmap ahead. It’s one of those hyper deflation tokens that looks much more promising than the other ones available. 

Would love to open a discussion with some of you regarding this. 

The main idea behind FEG Token is to provide a decentralized transaction network, which operates on the Ethereum blockchain (ERC-20) and the Binance Smart Chain (BEP-20). The path forward for FEG Token is determined by market fluctuations, but the model it runs on begs FEG Token to succeed.
FEG Token is a hyper-deflationary token with a maximum circulating supply of 100Q (quadrillion) on both the Ethereum blockchain and the Binance Smart Chain that involves an inaccessible burn wallet. Depending on each holder’s percentage of ownership, a 2% transaction tax is distributed among all holders—this includes the burn wallet, which is essentially a holder that collects more tokens over time as transactions occur. As the circulating supply decreases, the scarcity of the token increases. This inversely proportional relationship constitutes a supply and demand model. There is no limit as to how many tokens can be burnt. Without a burning limit, holders get to enjoy a never-ending cycle of passive income with positive price pressure!

cip43r,"Before I start this discussion I would like to state that is not a shill for a specific network, protocol or token and my examples used are purely due to my experience, knowledge and situation that I am in.

I am a student that lives in an apartment building that uses prepaid electricity. Due to my own negligence and that of my room mate, we forgot to top up our account and my power has been turned off. 

My first problem with the entire system is that I can never actually see my exact balance. I receive a traditional sms once my balance is below a certain amount and when I deposit funds. I also can't see my actual usage and for all I know they steal my electricity. This is pure speculation, but there is no exact log.

On my way home I called the company and a nice lady answered and helped me. Our conversation consisted of the following:

1. From which bank did you pay?
2. Was an instantaneous payment used?

Immediately I said I don't know as it was my flat mate that paid but I gave an educated guess and she said it will take 24 hours to reflect. Secondly, she said because it wasn't instantaneous it might also be the reason why my power isn't on.

My first though after this conversation was, that if I were to send my flat mate some BTC and they had a Binance account, I could use any supported network. Original BTC, wrapped BTC on ERC20 or even BEP20 or BEP2. Either way, they would have received the payment as long as they gave me the network of choice's address. Thus, I could pay them almost instantly using any network and the fees and speed would be my choice. 

So are you telling me there are banks in Switzerland older than 100 years and all of the banks in my country have existed for more than 50 years and this surperior payment system cannot communicate between banks? So I have banking fees because my bank has a dedicated team of developers working on a glorified SQL server which cannot communicate with others?

Secondly, there exists a special payment for me to send funds to other banks?

So you are telling me, interoperability between blockchains is own of the essential features we all on this sub want, but my bank can't even do that? And if I want interoperability I need to pay an extra fee for my bank account to talk to another.

Finally, why do I even need this company and 2 different banks? Why can't my meter have a wallet of its own or be some kind of IOT device using something like Nano or IOTA or even BTC or ETH, where I deposit the funds directly into the device? Why do I need to send a payment from one bank, to another and then some desk jockey makes changes on a SQL server to reflect my payment?

This entire situation is just so frustrating. My payment is somewhere in limbo and I am sitting without electricity because the current surperior payment system doesn't offer interoperability unless I essentially pay a fine for having the fucking audacity to move funds out of my bank account. 

TLDR: We need decentralization and current blockchains employ better interoperability than the traditional financial system.",0,A story: my experience with a bank en centralised entity and why we need decentralization

I'm sure this is common knowledge to most of you here, but when researching various other assets - stocks, metals, ETFs etc, I was pleasantly surprised to see a number of coins with market caps rivalling some of the worlds biggest companies, not to mention keeping up and exceeding market caps of almost all precious metals. Except the big two!

Let's hope this post ages poorly, for all the right reasons. 

# The takeaway - BTC

* There are only 5 companies in the world with a bigger market cap than Bitcoin. That is, Saudi Aramco and the 4 tech giants (Apple, Microsoft, Google and Amazon).
* There are only two metals with a bigger market cap than Bitcoin. Silver and Gold.
* That puts Bitcoin at #8 on the list.

# Some more takeaway - ETH

* Perhaps more surprising to me was Ethereum, making it to #17 on this list.
* Etherum has bigger market cap than some massive multinationals. Johnson &amp; Johnson, Samsung and MasterCard to name a few.

# The challengers

* BTC needs to increase by approximately 15% to 72.8K USD to overtake silver
* BTC needs to increate by approximately 42% to 89K USD to overtake Amazon
* The bulls on here would have you believe both of those are doable by the end of 2021. IMO overtaking silver this year is all but inevitable, Amazon may be a tougher nut to crack.

9 days ago I used BitBay platform in order to pay via Binance to buy FIFA22 from http://Gamivo.com, everything was going very well.

Until the transaction has been made, I waited for the game to arrive but when it took too long I contacted the support team of Gamivo but they said that the "" the payment did not reach us. it should be returned by the payment provider as soon as possible"".

As the attached files show the transaction has been made and I paid to the correct address and the amount required in ETH (cryptocurrency via Binance smart chain), and the amount has been taken away from my Binance wallet.

I want to know what is the issue here exactly because I have been contacting the Gamivo support for a while now, but they didn't give me any helpful support and kept saying that the payment provider will return your money. As i can understand binance are the payment provider !

ChiefKeithh,"I probably would have sold for a hefty loss if it wasn’t for Reddit so thank you.

It all began around May this year when my friend was telling me about his sweet crypto gains. I wanted some.

With an intention of buying and not looking at it again for 5 years, I slapped a fat lump sum investment across BTC, ETH and MATIC. Buying BTC at $60k and a +$2 MATIC as well, I can’t remember the ETH entry but can’t imagine it was great. I forgot to mention I didn’t even know what a blockchain was at this point.

Obviously we all know what happened in May. I can’t lie soiled my pants when when the market plummeted. Little did I know, that soil would be the fertiliser that made me grow into the man I am today. Luckily I turned to Reddit before cashing it all out, I was close, but even though 50% of the sub seemed to have also soiled themselves some of you managed to relieve my worries, so thanks.

You taught me the importance of knowing what I was investing my money into. So I went and learnt what a blockchain was, those things are pretty cool. Although I did hit a point where I thought because I could explain to my friends what a blockchain was, that it made me some kind of crypto god and started swapping a load of them around daily. Let’s just say I learned the hard way.

5 months on, I now have a sensible DCA strategy in place. Only investing in coins that I personally believe in, not what user MegaFartSniffer69 thinks is going to the moon.

As a beginner I can’t really contribute much to the sub so I thought I’d just make a bit of a thank you post since I was so happy to have finally made some gains!

I am an ardent fan and user of CRO token. I had this question that the CRO token is more like a stable coin, its price doesn't rise up as fast.

I sometimes wonder that it is in the best interest of Crypto.com, to keep this price as such. As most of their products requiring staking of say, 10,000 CRO tokens, which a layman like me can afford.

However, if the price were to shoot up to say, $1 this requirement would go up to $10K, which mot people wouldn't be able to afford. CRO is mostly controlled by the crypto.com exchange.

anon_ghost_123,"Hi guys,

I'd like to know the best place to invest my salary, and make stable passive returns.

I'm good on the programming side (I'm a Smart Contract Dev for a DAO), but I'm a finance noob.

I'm not interested in more complex stuff (like Leverage Trading). I know my limitations and won't get into anything I don't understand.

I'm also not interested in methods that require a lot of work (constantly checking prices and whatnot). I want it to be as passive as possible. Invest and forget.

I saw these:

* [https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/pitnji/using\_cryptos\_to\_earn\_passive\_income\_my/](https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/pitnji/using_cryptos_to_earn_passive_income_my/)

But instead of comparing the overall methods, I want to get more specific (protocols and trading pairs).

From what I've seen, the main candidates are:

* Anchor Protocol (\~20% APY, decentralized)
* Lending USDT (\~30% APY, centralized)
* Staking
* Providing Liquidity for Dexes

A few questions:

1. Rates of 20% and 30% seem to good to be true. Are these rates untrusworthy? Or is my perception skewed due to the crappy rates offered by banks?
2. Comparing KuCoin USDT Lending and Anchor Protocol:
   1. How would you compare security between them? While Anchor is decentralized, Kucoin is not. How trustworthy is Kucoin USDT lending?
   2. I have my doubts around USDT. I prefer either algorithmic stablecoins (like DAI or UST) or USDC because at least is backed by something. Is using USDT even a good idea?
   3. Lending USDT on Kucoin has higher returns than Anchor because it compounds daily, right? If so, are any there other suitable candidates with daily compounding?
3. If I was to provide liquidity for a Dex, would providing liquidity for a stablecoin pair (USDC/DAI or USDC/USDT) remove the risk of impermanent loss?
4. Staking seems simple, but I have some doubts regarding PoS. Aren't the staking rewards basically causing inflation? Yeah, a coin might have 50% staking rewards, but wouldn't its price just eventually drop, making the staking itself pointless?
5. I'd like to use this passive income for a living. Do I have to keep all of my funds locked in these protocols? Or can I keep the initial investment locked, but make monthly withdrawals of the returns? Maybe I can even withdraw any amount I want?

Any other suggestions?

sylsau,"You're interested in Bitcoin, but you're afraid to jump into this new world. What's stopping you? Mainly, the fear of losing money. After all, the powerful people at the head of the current system keep telling you that Bitcoin is dangerous because it is too volatile.

The main reason they talk about Bitcoin is so that you don't do your own research and realize that Bitcoin's volatility will only impact you in the short term. If you buy Bitcoin with a long-term view, then this volatility will no longer be an issue.

Furthermore, not taking action with Bitcoin is exactly what makes you lose money.

Indeed, while you are hesitating, your purchasing power in US dollars is being eaten away by inflation which has been above 5% for several months in America. Contrary to what Jerome Powell tried to make you believe, the situation will not be transitory. This inflation will persist and it is up to you to take care of your future regarding money.

Once you understand that you need to invest, you will ask yourself the question of which markets to go into.

If you take a quick look, you'll see that the real estate market is already overheating in the middle of a bubble. The stock market is moving at record levels, but that's not likely to last forever. Commodities have risen sharply in 2021, and a correction is expected in 2022.

Inflation-linked bonds may be an option given the very high inflation we have to deal with, but I am not a fan of this kind of product.

Gold may be an option, but the precious metal has been struggling to convince since the summer of 2020 when the price per ounce exceeded $2,000. Gold is underperforming while we are in the midst of great monetary inflation. This is a signal that something is changing. Gold is slowly but surely leaving the hearts of investors.

If gold is leaving the hearts of investors, it is primarily because another store of value has been emerging for several years. This is Bitcoin, which has proven since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic that it can act as a safe haven in times of crisis.

Since the beginning of the pandemic, the price of Bitcoin has increased tenfold. More and more investors see Bitcoin as a digital version of gold. Of course, Bitcoin allows for much more than that, but as it stands, that's how many investors view the digital currency invented by Satoshi Nakamoto.

Bitcoin also has the advantage of being perfectly suited to tomorrow's world where everything will become digital. Future generations will see Bitcoin as normalcy, while gold will be seen as something impractical and outdated.

So taking action with Bitcoin is a way to keep up with the world while protecting the fruits of your labor from the inflation that will continue to wreak havoc in the months and years to come.",0,For those who are still hesitating to take action - Why buying Bitcoin is a no-brainer when inflation will continue to hurt your wealth in the months and years to come
ragnarokfps,"I've been a gamer since 1997, I also like my crypto. For those of you who like crypto (particularly NFT's), but aren't gamers, here's a friendly bit of advice. Don't hold your breath for NFT gaming to happen. It will never happen, and here's why. It's pretty simple, really. Gamers fucking *hate* microtransactions. Period, full stop. But to explain how this came to be, you have to understand what video games are, and why people play them. Once you understand that, you will know why NFT's don't mix with video games. 

On May 15, 2012, the long awaited Diablo 3 game came out. This is one of the most popular and well-known video game franchises in the world, with it's successor having released 12 years earlier in 2000. Diablo fans had been waiting for this game a very long time. This game came out in 2012 with an in-game auction house, where players could buy and sell their gear for fake in-game gold, or real life hard currency, those greenbacks. This completely destroyed the game, and made national news headlines at least in the US. The game's developer and publisher were publicly flamed mercilessly on the internet by Diablo players until the developers decided to remove the auction from the game. This was such an outrage to gamers that this fiasco transcended the Diablo universe and enraged players had never even played a Diablo game. The backlash against this had never been seen before, or since. That was a painful lesson for Diablo's developers and publisher, and was more or less the equivalent of a public execution in the town square for what's now commonly known today as microtransactions in video games. 

Sinfe then, every time a game developer put microtransactions in their video games, they were publicly humiliated by the gamers that play those games, with countless lawsuits and even federal laws and regulations being put in place to prevent certain kinds of microtransactions. This is all public knowledge at this point, 9 years later, so you can PreSearch microtransactions in video games or Diablo 3 auction house to your heart's content.

For your own sake, I don't recommend investing in gaming NFT's. There's a long and bitter history of microtransactions in video games, and if that shit fiat currency can't even make it work, NFT's aren't going to fare any better.

&gt;T Moons is against the terms of service. To deter this activity, we have removed several subreddits dedicated to T Moons and will continue to monitor for similar subreddits.

this is the words from TOS

&gt;Community Points have no monetary value (i.e., are not a cash account or equivalent), cannot be S to other users, and cannot be X for cash or for any other goods and services outside of Reddit’s virtual goods or services.

yall read that? **YOU SHOULD BECAUSE THIS IS VERY IMPORTANT**

Now onto the change ---- you guys might have known about new community points launching for sub hiphop and while this topic was raised in the CC telegram group yesterday, a new revised version of community points pdf was uploaded and it had lot of bullish changes --

here comes the big deal --- *drumrolls please*

&gt;Community Points are ERC-20 Ethereum tokens. Over time, as Community Points migrate out  
&gt;  
&gt;of beta to the main Ethereum blockchain, you can use your Community Points anywhere your  
&gt;  
&gt;community hangs out and anywhere they’re supported. They are built to be compatible with  
&gt;  
&gt;major crypto wallets and usable on other apps and websites.  
&gt;  
&gt;You can create custom tools for Community Points in novel ways because they are based on  
&gt;  
&gt;the ERC-20 Ethereum standard. For example, **you can accept Points as proof of Reddit**  
&gt;  
&gt;**reputation on your site, create private spaces for Points holders, or accept Points in exchange**  
&gt;  
&gt;**for goods and services.**

Business-Typical,"Lawmakers are considering taxing the unrealized capital gains of billionaires as a way to raise money to help pay for President Joe Biden’s broad social and climate spending plans.

sheetsjohn16,"Hi :)

I've made a new educational video that will teach you how to analyze wallets, contracts, and blockchain transactions on BSCScan (Same as EtherScan and PolyScan, etc..).

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x61IVwXfXNI](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x61IVwXfXNI)

We will learn how to read transactions, how to track wallets, contracts and monitor the flow of the money and the tokens on the Binance Smart Chain network.

 We will also learn how to track our own wallets and see what kind of tokens we have and what transactions we send and receive.

Working with blockchain trackers like BSCScan, EtherScan, PolygonScan, etc, is very important and if you know how to read transactions and track wallets and smart contracts, your level of understanding in Crypto and DEFI will be much higher.

You will be able to understand your assets, investments, your trades, and the functions that you call in smart contracts, instead of being a noob who is just clicking buttons and doesn't understand what it does in the backend.

Also, tracking the blockchain using websites like BSCScan, you can find good trading and investments opportunities by tracking relevant interesting wallets.

This guide should cover and give very good fundamentals in order to start monitoring and tracking DEFI and blockchains.

Would be more than happy to hear what you think about this guide :)

Thanks,

Based on previous trends,  [BTC ](https://www.tradingview.com/symbols/BTCUSD/)   retraces each major move up to the .5 fibonacci level. So it falls  back 50% of it's major move up to 'consolidate' before moving upwards  again.

Based on the recent major move to $65k, an  [fibonacci extension](https://www.tradingview.com/ideas/fibonacciextension/)  can be used to measure that move and aid us in predicting the next major  [resistance level](https://www.tradingview.com/ideas/supportandresistance/)  and also complete  [Elliot Wave](https://www.tradingview.com/ideas/elliottwaves/)  part 5. The  [Fibonacci Extension](https://www.tradingview.com/ideas/fibonacciextension/)   predicts that based on a retrcement to $54-56k area, the an extended  move will reach $80k. This logically makes sense as traders love round  numbers to work with. If the $80k dollar is exceeded on a pump through,  the next resistance would be at the  [1.618 extension](https://www.tradingview.com/ideas/1618fibonacciextension/)  , which is $96k.

Please note that I'm using Kraken so I can't buy crypto that are not listed even though I'm thinking to open a Binance account just for LUNA (do you think it worth it?)
This is my current portfolio with the reasons behind my picks:
15% BTC and 35% ETH (I'd like to leave king &amp; queen at 50% and the other half of my portfolio in altcoins but I'm also wondering if BTC percentage is a little too low)
12% ADA, 12% SOL and 12% DOT (I'm keeping the Ethereum killers trinity in staking for a total of 36% of my portfolio staked)
10% LINK (why choose between de-fi projects when all of them need an oracle? LINK is probably the best oracle currently and already made many partnerships)
4% SC (my penny crypto bet, riskier than the others but I think it has a good value if compared with FIL which is technically worse, also imo decentralized cloud storage is one of the best use cases for blockchain after de-fi)

but couple of days ago it happens something crazy to me and now here I am leaving behind my HODLing strategy, and I don't think I'm going to regret it 🙂

While I was taking a walk in a nice street full of shops, as usual I opened my wallet to check the crypto balance (this is something I still do twice per day). In this specific wallet I opened I only have BTC and the amount I saw was € X.

Right after closing the app, my eyes went to a display window of a jewelry store where a wonderful ring was looking at me! It was a very nice ring that would have fitted just perfectly my lady 's hand and crazy things: the price was € X, exactly the one of my Satoshis balance 😲.

It was actually identical to the penny! 😲

Solutar,"Hello everyone,

Memecoins are making massive price rally’s and are quickly picked up in cryptospaces, like this one, and everyone is talking about them more and more which seems to reflect on the Price. 
For example when Elon musk mentioned Dogecoin the price literally exploded.

So I was wondering how did BTC start? I mean it was a revolutionary idea that was also picked up by many, but was it because of its utility as store of value, or more because hipsters and tech geeks and others hyped it up? It doesn’t seem to me like a memecoin but it’s price is raising too.

I’ve seen some people say this is just how the market is working at the moment, utility is being forgotten and only hype and memes are important. But if so, for how long? I would be depressingly frustrated if projects with GREAT utility die because the market favors memecoins.

Anyway, I’m just a bit confused about the whole crypto situation at the moment, so if anyone with a little bit more knowledge could tell me what’s going on, that would be great, thank you.

SpaceFaceMistake,"TLDR: What study units or courses should I learn formal or informal to gain better understanding in finances with end goal of managing my own crypto and or other exchanged positions?

To start here is some basic info on my finacial and crypto history. 

I have a small amount of crypto of which has been earned from learning, referring or from legitimate giveaways or tips. I don’t own any other stocks or shares. I understand income tax and capital gains tax. I understand how crypto works more than I do for fiat and or business stocks. I am yet to put any of my own money into any market on the stock exchange.

Within the 18 months I’ve been following and learning about cryptocurrency I’ve learned the basics. I know how to store and securely access and transact crypto being on the chain not on a wallet as I, like many assumed to start with. I know the main terms in the crypto space and some terms within finances. I can make some sense of charts and some indicators that are easily read but I don’t have any in-depth charting knowledge or know how. I have always been good with math/numeracy over english/literacy.

I don’t plan on trading but I may end up trading. I am more interested for now on how to invest and invest well. I mean unless there is a good reason I should learn to trade first before learning to invest? 

Basically I just feel like I need to do some proper study that leads to experience though work placement. With the study leading to understanding and then to comfortably investing on my own. Like for anything non-crypto it would be way smarter and safer to use a broker as their knowledge outweighs mine 10 fold.

To me the same applies to crypto but there aren’t personal brokers for it except for the very new ETFs. It’s that those that understand finacial markets before or while crypto has been around, they will be able to understand the crypto markets a whole lot better than any crypto enthusiast or follower or owner. Unless those followers or owners were or are finacial brokers or have learned finacial systems and that of what a broker would learn and the experience from holding a job in finance or stock broking.

Ideally I need a course or field of study long and or short that would help open my eyes to how finances, economy and the stock market works. I mean I’ve been told to learn accounting but I still don’t know if that would be ideal or if another field of study would be better suited to the study of finacial markets leading to having a greater understanding in finance to be able to make decisions on my own with regard to crypto and other markets positions.

Monster_Chief17,"ICOs are back and this time they are disguised as ""gaming tokens"". Just like all of them flopped, NFT gaming will probably have to suffer a similar fate. Here are a few reasons why I think that:


* Getting started with NFT games can cost a few thousand. And this is just to **get started**. They all boast about a play-to-earn model but no one is telling you that you need $3k to actually have a chance to earn. There are very few people that actually have that kind of money to throw into the fire so there is very little chance any of these games manage to acquire a decent player base.


* Most of these games aren't even games. They are just roadmaps and promise that you will get a game but you need to wait.  ICO survivors still have PTSD from *Soon™*.


* Commenting NFT gaming on Ethereum is pointless at this point. It's like paying $50 to make one move in a game of chess that you are trying to play for fun.


* Lastly, most ""games"" I found that are actually playable on cheaper blockchains like Wax or Fantom are either simple clicking games or very shitty ones made in Unity.



I can give props to Gods Unchained and a handful of others but it is really not looking good so far.

Last Elon Musk tweet again confirm that what he's aiming for is a lowest in fee, instant, secure, ecological and scalable coin.
Many of his tweets are speaking about it and I trully believe he already know about Nano's existance, but doesn't get the reason why he still doesn't speak about Nano for the moment.

Nano has all the best of this features :
- Instant : under 1s/transactions
- Feeless : absolutely 0 fees, their can't be less than 0 fees
- scalable : more than 1000 transactions per second
- ecological : all the network can run on 1 wind turbine
- resistant to inflation : limited in number, no mining


A rumor also is circulating on Twitter that Elon Musk probably already is accumulating Nano :

I strongly advise to people interrested in Nano to look forward to the Nano Reddit community to get more informations about  this blockchain.",0,Nano can be what Elon Musk is looking for

nikil1253,"As most people who own bitcoin know, price drawdowns that are greater than 50% have been a regular occurrence after each all-time high. What we also know is that bitcoin price has proven to significantly recover from every major drawdown, which has made it the best performing asset over the last decade

Currently we're rebounding from a 56% price drawdown post a 228% recovery, Historically what comes next is yet another massive recovery. This double top pattern playing out is eerily similar to 2013 where price went on to explode over 10 times in just 52 days, starting in early October. As we hover around $66,000, a six-figure bitcoin price is only a 51% price move away. This is a more conserative percentage move during a bitcoin bull cycle recovery based on previous cycles

History may not repeat itself exactly but all of the on-chain metrics, recent price action and expectations of new entrant demand, during the most bullish holder behavior in bitcoin's history, have signaled a major price recovery underway.

At its core, bitcoin price is a function of new demand, through increased adoption, relative to the amount of limited supply available on the market.

reaglesham,"And so my journey begins. As a not-very-wealthy dude who’s employment was sideswiped by COVID and is yet to fully recover, its tough to keep DCA going for my small crypto investments. Because I believe in crypto, I started small, making tiny savings here and there, and over time my philosophy has changed. When you don’t have much to work with and you try to invest, you look at that beer, sandwich or new videogame and think “do I really need this?”. I started re-evaluating my expenses - do they actually make me happy?

Around the same time, my fitness began to wane and I realised how much money I was spending on alcohol, junk food and unhealthy snacks. Fitness is a big deal for me, so I decided to get back on that horse - working out and eating the classic diet of chicken, rice and broccoli. As I work to improve my health, I feel better about myself. Sure, the junk food tastes good, but the effect it has on my fitness was detrimental to my mood in the long run. Is the momentary bliss of a cheeseburger worth the long-term hit to my self-esteem (and arteries)? When I’m in good health, I’m in a good mood, so it’s best to cut out those expensive, unhealthy purchases in favour of a more humble diet - plus it leaves me more for crypto.

Videogames, streaming services and movies bring me a lot of enjoyment, but I’m sitting on a backlog of games I’ve never played, movies I’ve never watched and streaming services I don’t often use. Why chase the next new game when 2018’s back catalogue is still barely played? Cutting these, I either value the purchases I’ve made more, or decide to spend my time doing other, potentially more fulfilling things. It’s a win-win - plus it leaves me more for crypto.

The tenets of the crypto monk began to emerge:

* **Do not chase fleeting happiness** as it will quickly fade. Find joy in the experiences that you cherish, and explore the experiences you have undervalued until now.
* **What strengthens the body emboldens the mind** and with health comes happiness.
* **If you truly see value in something, it is worth the expense** \- the life of the crypto monk is about living well and valuing your life, not reducing your enjoyment of life to chase financial gain. If you believe a purchase will improve your life, do it. If it falls short, you’ll know more about yourself and what you value for next time.
* **Invest what you save into your future**. May your financial security bring you peace in the years to come.
* **Don’t chase pumps.** This way lies destruction.

From now on I hope to value what I have, and enrich my life rather than filling it with frivolous purchases. My health will improve, my mental health along with it, and all of this will leave me more money to invest in crypto projects I believe in - hopefully reducing the financial turmoil of my future.

Now if you need me, I’ll be in my monastery performing my daily ritual of chart-watching and praying to the great bulls to free us from the clutches of the bears that wish to pull us down.",0,I’ve decided to become a Crypto Monk

Cringerli,It's end of month and the salary is finally here. I've been working hard for this. My birthday is next week and I told everyone that this year it's gonna be just a huge pot of French onion soup to celebrate because all my money from the bank is going into crypto!!! I'm new to this whole crypto thing and I can tell something big is coming. Brad my buddy from work said I should buy SafeMoon but I'm not quite sure about it. He also bought Worldcoin but I don't have a good feeling about that one. I'm putting all of my money on Tether because it's only $0.99999 right now and it's a top 10 coin!!!! also green is my lucky color so wish me luck!,0,I just bought a big bag of top 10 coins to HODL and make me rich!
Mettez,"I'm not sure what exact emotion it triggers within me, but a part of me truly feels happy and giddy every time I see MSM talking about so called 'memecoins'. I'm not personally invested in them, my heart can't take it. I was lucky enough to have a lucky 200% gain on Doge a while back before I pulled out, and I didn't dare putting any money in Shiba. Nevertheless, it never feels like I'm 'left out', instead it really triggers my funny bone every time these coins are mentioned by the 'classier' news outlets.

I really think we (as in, people active on r/cc) severely underestimate (or underestimated perhaps) the strength and place 'memecoins' have in the crypto market. I understand that tokenomics are important, and that a lot of people might/will be rug pulled, but we cannot deny that memecoins are a great way to attract new people to the space. Let me rephrase:

People unfamiliar with investing/crypto usually don't care about jargon like APR, APY, staking, impermanence loss, market cap, etc. So, they aren't 'attracted' to the same information that we care about, as we now have been in the space for at least some time. Using myself as a practical example, dogecoin is what got me initially interested in crypto. Call it, a gateway crypto. Because of me wanting to own some (not caring about making a lot of money just yet, only putting in x euros), I made my first account on an exchange. That lead me to checking out other crypto names, and seeing those few euros turn into a few more, drove me to reading about actually investing in crypto. I made my first wallet(s), got a bit more informed, and now I'm actually investing a relatively large part of my liquid net value in crypto. I'm no longer into memecoins, but not because I don't think they matter, I'm just not willing to take part in the risk involved.

However, I think that some people forget how they started out, or that not everyone is aware of how investing works and what to watch out for when they are younger. Add the complexity of the crypto space as a whole to it, and all of a sudden, funny dog currencies as a meme seem extremely plausible! You know, in a very weird way, meme's were the original 'decentralized' internet interactions. Nobody 'bought' a meme, or could pay for one, the collective decided what meme's grew or became popular, almost like how funny dog coins are behaving now.. 🤔",0,It honestly makes me happy to see regular media outlets reporting on the rising 'memecoin' phenomenon

Mr_bike,"I teach in East Asia and I was expecting students to be asking me if I own any bitcoin or crypto last week or this week. My lesson topic this week for second years is 'technology and the future', so this just lined up pretty well (my curriculum was made weeks before the semester started). My first semester here and I have students asking if I own stocks, I tell them, no, but they don't ask about crypto. They know about Doge though, for sure. I brought up SpaceX today and students refer to Elon as that, 'Doge guy'. So they see those memes. In the libraries I see books about blockchain and skimming through it, it is certainly about the tech.

Here they are pretty crazy about crypto as well. I have a couple of friends here that admittedly are just gambling on ripple winning a lawsuit and making a breakthrough and have no idea the tech behind any of this. It's admittedly a problem for some because they will spend their workday trying to day trade shitcoins like doge, get recktd and lose their job.

I guess where I'm going with this is, I thought BTC breaking an ATH meant that everyone would be talking about it because crypto was mainstream and cool now. Nah, I guess this is still just magic internet money and it won't be on more people's minds until it is all making 50%&lt; gains in a week.

I was hoping when I was doing a word wall about technology this week some students would say bitcoin or blockchain, so far I am disappointed. A couple of weeks ago I used AI pics as a warmup and how deepfakes could be dangerous for news in the future. With the news of Associated Press opening a node on LINK, I've just been jumping at the bit to reference that in class. How blockchain can fight misinformation. Maybe it is just my students but it only seems like I have only two student out of 420ish (I'm not memeing on that either) interested in blockchain.

I guess I will have to give it another month when BTC is hitting crazy levels for students to be trying to talk to me about it. If they ask, I'm just gonna say that it is interesting technology but I can't invest because I am a foreigner and the bank won't let me buy it.

After some (admittedly, not enough) research, I transfered the money to a wallet in Coinbase, where I tried figuring out how to cash out.
 
Turns out, coinbase can't cash out in my country, and I couldn't figure out how to transfer that money to anywhere like paypal. I don't know about all the other different wallets, but is there any way I could cash out that money in Brazil?",0,"Need help, I'm really dumb with this"

I’m seeing a bright future with these next few months. And with altcoin season approaching, now is a great time to stake and loan! Right now, I absolutely love staking. The interest rates are astronomically higher than those offered by fiat savings accounts.

Right now, I'm staking my **Tezos** and **Cardano** using **Ledger**, and also did some lending on [**Celsius**](https://celsius.network/), [**Haru Invest**](https://haruinvest.com/), and Nexo because their yields have much higher percentages (also risky lol), so I diversified with both staking and lending instead to get the best of both because the compounding will add up quite a bit over the coming year(s) (Hopefully).

Staking is unquestionably safer when done with a cold wallet, but I think that most lending businesses strive to ensure that their customers are as secure as possible too. Like seriously though, Get staking (or loan/lend) people. We're going to have a lot of fun in the future!

After challenging all you 'experts' to answer the question posed in a mature and thoughtful way and getting pelted with the usual juvenile trash that is the hallmark of soft-bellied, bespectacled Dungeons &amp; Dragons-esque  nebbishes that are resident on all  internet forums everywhere,  I was able to  sort  through the wild-eyed raving,  name-calling and the bizarre theories on dismantling the global financial system and rebuilding it in some whacky hodge-podge of cartoon character ""NFT's"" and then sift out the coherent responses of  the mature and rational 1%

I even read about people being happy that they sold their ""shitcoins"" to buy ""real projects"" like ada, dot or terra. And people commenting that this is wise and everybody should do that. 

I trade for several years now with coins and regardless that i made the mode out of eth and btc, i have to say, that this ""real project"" stuff is bullshit. 

&amp;#x200B;

Why? This is really easy to explain: 

Did you ever integrate some of those ""real projects"" into your project? pretty surely not. Do you have a friend who did? Pretty surely not. They might have a useability (e.g. brave token/bat and filecoin) but nobody really uses it (for now).

Bitcoin

The most potential use use case of a coin is the transaction method. And every coin is providing this. Bitcoin is the most preferrable, because it is well known on the black market for long.

To Summarize: 

The projects might have a future, but for today:   
A filecoin has as much usability as a shiba inu coin. They are just not used today.

warmarrer,"Hi everyone, I've been doing some grid trading so I've been watching a few coins pretty closely, and I've noticed something I don't understand happening with HAKA/USDT pairing on kucoin.  

The price has been pushing upward pretty consistently at around 0.3200, but every time it gets momentum a GIANT sell order appears .0020 to .0030 below the current trading price and drives it down, but then disappears off the order book before it fills.  Then, when the price starts up again it appears long enough to kill momentum and disappears again.  It started with around 120k and has slowly fallen to around 35k.

Why am I seeing this?  If you were trying to sell off a coin wouldn't you want it to go higher and so sell in smaller chunks?  

Also an hour earlier I saw something similar happening except the order would appear, disappear, and then appear again but .001 lower each time laddering the price down, it happened for around 10 minutes or so.

CryptoSorted,"Tax them to death...


A new tax law is being proposed in the US which will require cryptocurrency investors to pay taxes on the profits from their investments even before they sell their coins.


If this ridiculous law is passed, it will:


1. Force you to sell your crypto when you're in profit, which would keep further price increase in check. Thus reducing the opportunity to make further gains.


2. Make everyone a ninja, doing everything to conceal their crypto wealth.


3. Probably discourage people from investing in crypto in the first place.



My hope is that they also make provision to pay us for unrealized losses on our crypto assets. At least this will encourage me to gamble more on shitcoins without fear.

I've seen a few social media posts from people just learning about NFTs getting frustrated that some of the different collections take research to figure out first, before being able to make an informed purchase. This illustration is meant to serve as a reminder that many NFTs can be thought of as ""collectibles"" (in addition to ""fine art"", ""game assets"" or other ""utility"" aspects), and for most collecting hobbies in the non-digital world, there's a connotation that some research is needed to start that ""hobby"", and that's okay.

In that photo are a few items that might have intrinsic worth to a collector. Most adults will know that there are some people who collect coins, and some old coins are worth a lot of money, even if they themselves don't collect coins. Same with trading cards; even if you don't want to own trading cards to play a game with them, seeing a trading card in a hard plastic sleeve gives a hint that the owner thought it valuable enough to give it another layer of protection, so maybe it's most valuable, since the coin doesn't have a protective case? That device pictured looks like a smartphone; it might be fairly valuable, if it's a recent model? Even for someone who's not extremely tech-savvy, they'd be able to guess it's not *decades* old, since they didn't make smartphones back then.

My point is that it would likely take someone at least a few hours research to determine the worth of these things, if they weren't a collector already. When approaching NFT projects that aren't just ""fine art"" pieces, we haven't yet reached a level of public awareness of what ""hints"" a casual observer can recognize as cues (like the hard case protecting a trading card a lot of adults would recognize as interpret as a clue of value), and so it takes a bit more research to become aware what the nuances of each collection are. So, I guess this is partly a fun exercise in comparing physical to digital collectibles, and partly my plea/reminder to be helpful to newcomers as they try and gain those ""reflexes"" for what to look for, and if you are a newcomer, to realize this is a new ""skill"" and so it's okay if it takes at least a little bit of work to understand, and not to feel discouraged if it doesn't ""click"" right away.

Token offerings (sometimes called Initial Coin Offerings, or ICOs) are a way for crypto projects to raise funding and an opportunity for investors to make money by buying new project tokens before their prices rise on the market. 

While many token offerings were legitimate, and many projects failed because of simple business or economic reasons, scams involving token offerings were widespread from 2014 onwards as scammers took advantage of the crypto hype, a lack of awareness of how crypto worked, and human flaws like greed and fear. 

Token offering scams have fallen significantly after Huobi launched its Huobi Prime token offering platform in 2017. This is also due in part to better public education about how cryptocurrencies work, but also because of the simplified and verified process that Huobi Prime uses to evaluate new projects before allowing them on our platform. 

Even though investors on the Huobi Prime platform can rest easy, many scams still happen outside of Huobi’s ecosystem and a savvy investor must learn how to identify and avoid them. 

Here are some of the most popular scams committed as a token offering: 

 

# The Exit Scam 

The exit scam happens when an insider raises funds for the project and subsequently closes or exits the project with raised funds. This leaves the investor with a bag of tokens with no inherent value.  

This can either happen with a token project or an exchange that is raising funds. Like in the case of Thodex, where the founder, Ozer, disappeared with investors' funds. 

# Airdrop Scam 

Airdrop refers to free tokens given to investors in exchange for adoption of a new platform, purchase of new tokens, or locking in of tokens. 

A project will usually allocate a portion of the token supply to be distributed to investors, by doing so, it allows the token project owners to gather a mass audience with the pretense of giving out free cryptocurrency. 

The scam works by getting parties interested in the airdrop to submit personal information, private keys or purchasing tokens to receive more airdrops. The interested parties may get the airdropped tokens, but these tokens might not have value or very little value as compared to the information that the scammers have obtained. 

The OmiseGo airdrop scam is one of the largest scams in the history of crypto. OmiseGo (OMG) was supposed to be airdropped in September 2017, but it got postponed. Scammers took this opportunity, creating fake Twitter handles, Telegram chat groups, fake Forums threads and sites, tricking unsuspecting users into submitting their private keys. It was reported that more than 300 Ether were lost to scammers. 

# Phishing Scams 

Even today, phishing scam is one that many investors fall for. Scammers disguise as legit entities or a trusted source deceives the victim into thinking that his or her account is getting hacked. Which subsequently, the victim will be brought to a fake site that resembles the legit entity. The victim is then prompted to change sensitive information like passwords and 2FA, of which, the scammer can access the victim’s account to perform malicious transactions. 

It is reported that such scams have [rose more than 1000%](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/bitcoin-cryptocurrency-investment-scams/) and cost investors almost $80 million dollars. 

# Pump and Dump 

During a token offering or token sale, investors exchange their cryptocurrencies for the new token. The project owner or team will share in their whitepaper how many tokens will be released for sale, set aside for future development and so on. 

 📷Figure 1:Axie Infinity Token Breakdown | www.axieinfinity.com  

 

Most project have a soft cap and hard cap of how much funds they will be raising. Often, whales will enter this space to buy up majority of the tokens which leaves very little for investors who truly support the project. 

And upon exchange listing, these whales send signal to various social media group indication that the token is a “Buy” as it is undervalued and will spike in the next couple months. Following this, the whales will dump these tokens as the price start to rise, leaving investors with tokens that are worth a lot less than what they paid for.  

Smaller investors are on the losing of this because they are not able to leverage on ground floor prices when the tokens are released.",0,4 Types of Token Offering Scams and How to Avoid them

I hope you're all having a lovely Monday. 

**A little bit about me:**

I'm a late twenties professional who intends to retire before I am 40. My cryptocurrencies forms the risk-on portion of my overall portfolio, and I'm hoping to achieve at least a 1,000% return over the next decade. While I've dabbled in cryptocurrencies for a while now, it wasn't until June of this year that I dove deep. Like many of you, I'm anticipating that the next six months will return life changing returns. Unfortunately work has been crazy of late, and will continue to be all throughout the next three or so months, so I will have very little time to focus on my portfolio.

**Help me restructure my portfolio:**

Given that I will have next to no time and energy to devout to my portfolio over the next three months, what changes would you make to my portfolio to maximise the return on what is essentially a 'fire and forget' strategy for the imminent future? Obviously it goes without saying that I am not seeking financial advice; just your opinion on whether my portfolio is primed to ride the exponential wave in the coming months. I have a week or so to do research on any last changes to my portfolio, before I have to set it in stone. So if you were me what changes (if any) would you make?

— Buying Process:

Coinbase is the best starting point, Check if coin (remember SHIB, paid extra via CB wallet) is available on CB. If not, Try Coinbase Wallet. In rare circumstance, I would consider buying from another wallet.

Also, Check slippage before buying, CB wallet does not have a good way to check that. Use other wallets to cross check that and compare fee estimates too.

Hey All,

I have this idea for a token on Cardano that will be used to integrate debt and assests into the blockchain. Adding Assests will greatly inflate the price of the token and although adding debt seams like a bad idea. Debt is actually a good thing as long as you dont have alot of it.

It will function like a Bank with the difference being anyone person who owns the tokens is basically considererd a ""owner"" and will get a say on how the systems upgrades and operates moving forward.

The main reason I want to do this is to take money and power away from institutions and banks and put it back into the hands of those who actually own it. The People!

Owning tokens will entitle you to monthly payments. (payments can be in fiat or crypto)

Using Governance we could also set up a system that allows for lending which would truly make it a bank by the people for the people.

Why would you put your money into a system that will then use that money against you. We have to put and end to this madness and greed.

We are all in this together. Lets start acting like it.

I have a much more detailed plan on how we can achieve this and I need more people to get involved.

I dont give a shit about money, I dont want any money for doing this. I want a better world for all of us. One where people at the top don't even have the option to fuck us.

GarbageLeo,"Purely from his responses, a friend of his who is ""deep"" into crypto was telling him about the recent spike in the price of SHIB. He sounded excited and from the sounds of it, his friend had come away with a pretty hefty profit.  


Now, don't get me wrong; I don't hate SHIB. I don't own any, never will, but that's a decision I've made for myself. My cousin's friend, however, is known to invest in shoddy coins/tokens and doesn't really have a basic understanding of crypto as a whole. My cousin has described him as ""Like a native american tracking buffalo, ears to the ground type sh\*t"" when it comes to crypto and I legitimately believe he told my cousin SHIB can lead to some immense gains when realistically, it can only 2x to 2.5x and even THAT is being generous. My cousin sounded exuberant, even going so far as to revive his long-dead Coinbase account in order to buy some. I'm real scared he's going to lose a lot of money but I'm pretty sure he trusts this friend way more than he trusts someone like me.  


I hated hearing this conversation because my cousin is a believer in memes and has stated that the Shiba Inu meme Doge is his favorite, and has also heavily invested in DOGE. He's also into TRX, VET and some other projects that haven't seen movement or progress in ages (obviously VET has become a leading enterprise blockchain but in terms of price movement) so it kinda worries me.

PartTimeAnalyst,"Last week, BTCUSD experienced two historical moments. The first bitcoin-linked exchange-traded fund in the United States, ProShares Bitcoin Strategy ETF BITO, debuted on Tuesday. Following that, bitcoin reached an all-time high on Wednesday, trading near $67,000, surpassing its previous high of $64,889 in April, according to CoinDesk data, before falling over the weekend. Bitcoin was worth $61,257 as of 5 p.m. Sunday, down 7% in the previous five days but up 43% in the previous month.

ETHUSD also approached its all-time high, topping $4,300 on Thursday, just shy of its previous high of $4,379.11 in May. On Sunday, the price of ether was $4,090.

According to di Florio, ether futures ETFs, which are also traded at CME, may be more predictable than spot bitcoin ETFs. ""Because it's about futures,"" di Florio explained. ""And it follows the same path that led to the SEC's approval of the Bitcoin futures ETF."" As a result, they are likely to benefit from the same regulatory relief.""

VanEck and ProShares both dropped their applications for ether futures ETFs two days after filing them in August. Some analysts speculated that the SEC contacted both issuers and indicated that ether-linked ETFs were unlikely to be approved, at least not before bitcoin-linked ETFs were approved.

Saone1,"Recently I was listening Lex Friedman podcast with Sergey Nazarov (episode itself released 5months ago) and they went into how smart contracts on blockchain would help regular people if their country is corrupt  unreliable, has no services etc. One example they discussed was insurance for crops, how it would be more accessible if only options from country itself are expensive or just very bad in general (this part may be mixed from what i read in the video comments).

This got me thinking how can blockchain solve any problems related to 'expensive' part? Since services would be decentralised it would have to adjust its price to global market and therefore would be no good solution which price-wise would be optimal for Swiss and Zimbabwe alike. Either services for poor people would be inacessible or rich people would be even more richer because of the cheaper prices for services. Most of cryto prophets seems to avoid explanation for that.

It is just what you think it is, tiny price of .0000000000349 or close, even being up 400% this month. 100quadrillion supply. New small project with one of the devs spreading the word on Twitter.

Launched in April after being rescued.
Q4 ideas: farming, allowing people with dead coin or “rug pulled” projects to swap their coins into Shibaken for a second chance.

It really does have potential I believe but will need more support from the crypto community to launch on a CEX so for now it can only be bought on a few places, their website and YouTube videos give info about how to buy and convert with their bridge.

Also interesting it is a true deflationary coin where every transaction spreads 1% to holders and burns 1% of the total transaction.

druk_ware,"Hi Crypto community. I have something to say about most launchpads. Please correct me if I'm wrong. 

If you're unfamiliar with launchpads, here's a breakdown: 

Essentially, launchpads help crypto projects get initial funding from the general public. There is a whitelisting process selected at random in most cases, so not everyone gets to get in on a project early. **BUT, EVERYONE HAS THE SAME CHANCE TO GET IN.**

======================================================================

Let's take DAOmaker as an example. 

I found DAOmaker in February 2021, after they pivoted from a social mining platform to a platform whose core message was *""Venture Capital Re-Created for the Masses""* platform. 

Their DAO token was used as an entry to participate in the whitelisting process known as Strong Holder Offering. Projects could choose who they wanted to grant entry to, and participants could be refunded if the projects tank. **Sounds pretty fair, right? To me, it was.** 

(I'm sure they had some kind of advantage for users with more DAO tokens, but it was still generally more leveled than it is today.)

Come September 1st, 2021, when they introduced the new tiered system: 

&gt;Tranche 0:   
&gt;  
&gt;500 - 1,999 DAO “Early Adopters” Winning Chance 1.  
&gt;  
&gt;Tranche 1:    
&gt;  
&gt;2,000 - 3,999 DAO Winning Chance 4.67  
&gt;  
&gt;Tranche 2:    
&gt;  
&gt;4,000 - 9,999 DAO Winning Chance 9.76  
&gt;  
&gt;Tranche 3:    
&gt;  
&gt;10,000+ DAO Winning Chance 26  
&gt;  
&gt;Tranche 4:    
&gt;  
&gt;25,000+ DAO Winning Chance 69.5  
&gt;  
&gt;Tranche 5:    
&gt;  
&gt;50,000+ DAO Winning Chance 149  
&gt;  
&gt;""Early adopters"" refers to all users, who had a minimum of 500 DAO staked in the Vaults before September 1st, 2021 and kept it staked.   
&gt;  
&gt;All new entries are required 2,000 DAO in their Wallets for SHO participation. Winning chances mean increased winning chance to tranche 0. For example tranche 3 has required 20 times more DAO, but provides 26 times higher winning chances. It, therefore, provides a boost of 6x chance.

======================================================================

I'll admit, I bought into the new tiered system and got myself 2,000 DAO power.

**But, I still think what DAOmaker (and lots of other launchpads) is doing now goes against what they used to stand for:** ***To give retail investors a chance to join ICOs and presales even though they don't have the capital like institutional investors (I.E. VENTURE CAPITALISM RE-CREATED FOR THE MASSES).***

Tonnes of people get into crypto for a chance to get out of the rat race of earning low-middle income and live a peaceful leanFIRE life. 2,000 DAO at the peak is $17,500 (considered ATH: $8.75). That's way more than what a lot of people save per year. And they can't even use that money to invest in ICOs because it's stuck as DAO power. Then, they still have to scrounge another 200-500 BUSD which they don't have. Imagine buying at the ATH and losing $11,800 (using today's price of $2.85). Sounds a little unfair to me. 

On top of that, people with 50,000 DAO power essentially dominate the SHOs with 149 chances of winning an entry. Compared to the real O.G.s who stayed from the beginning who only have 1 pathetic chance of winning with 500 DAO power. 

In other words, the $142,500 is more likely to make another $10k with an entry to an ICO (or whatever IDO IEO nonsense) than someone with $1,425.  

DAOmaker is becoming the problem it was trying to solve. **What was once a leveled playing field where everyone had the same chance to win is now** ***peak capitalism––the exact problem crypto is trying to solve.*** 

It doesn't matter if everyone has a small chance to win. It's leveled. It's crypto. Deal with it. 

If you're some rich dude who wants an edge, then ask your rich dad for investment opportunities over at Lord Farquard's private equity firm and get off crypto. 

This also goes for any other launchpads with tiered entries like DuckStarter etc. 

I get that DAOmaker wants to make big bucks. Stop making crypto like high finance and capitalism and elitist. Then, stop labeling yourself as ""for the retailers"" and call it as it is. 

Thanks for coming to my ted talk.

(P.S. Props to Binance who has kept launchpads fair for all its users.) 

(P.P.S. Not affiliated, but if you're interested in getting into presales without the help of launchpads, [ICOdrops.com](https://ICOdrops.com) has a pretty great list of upcoming projects. Some don't hold their presales on these launchpads.)",0,The Ugly Side of Launchpads

The entire crypto market cap is 2.7 trillion . The entire market cap of JUST Apple stock alone is 2.5 trillion. Think about that. 1 public company is bigger than all of crypto currency combined.

About 5 months ago the same co-worker said I should check out my ETH I saw it was over 1000.00. Long story short I was hooked.

The biggest barrier for me was the technology first was doing KYC for the exchange I joined and figuring  how to use wallets and move my coins around the blockchain without losing any. I have decent computer skills but it was still a steep learning curve for me and I feel that is one of the reasons less people my age even try to invest in crypto. I am sure some boomers  hear about the returns that are possible but have not even heard of the blockchain let alone understand it.

 So i bought a couple books Bubble or Revolution and the Infinite machine. Listened to podcasts and watched YouTube videos. I also bought near the ATH and was shocked by my first big Dip last summer  luckily I had joined this Subreddit where I learned FOMO which I had just been guilty of, also Hodling and Staking and the strategy to DCA which I did during the last dip. And also  don't trust anyone and take all advice with a grain of salt and most importantly DYOR.I am now up 57 % so thank you to this community for the education i received here.

VegetableFortune7886,"Hi Everyone, this question has been bugging me for a long time and I am genuinely curious about what drives the technology and decision.

Let's hope I get this question explained correctly and it probably exists on many platforms but I have only seen it on kucoin.  I'll use an exact example.

I'm trying to trade coin ERG.  I see there is an open order in the buy section for $9 and 800 coins are in the open order.  Because ERG is traded in relatively low volume the order has been there for a while.  I make a decision to place an order for the exact value of the open order.  That order disappears before my order is executed.  

I would say that this is just a coincidence but it's happened numerous times.  The open order withdraws their order before my order is excited so I'm certain that something is gaming the system where likely arbitrage bots can likely see an order come in before it's executed and can pull the bot order.  At least that's what I'm thinking happens.

You would think smarter brains/actuaries actually know what they're doing and how to price appropriately. I actually have a big chunk of my ETH over at Celsius. This is a bit of a big red flag for me cuz this shows somebody at least is showing that Celsius is a much bigger risk than the others.

&gt;The idea behind Ethereum is ingenious: Connect computers from all over the world to build the most decentralized world-computer possible. However, we also all have seen the problems of the current, monolithic “one blockchain fits all” solution: Exploding fees, clogged network, long processing times and subsequently slow adoption in the real-world. You have all heard about Ethereum layer 2 solutions like Elrond or Polygon. But have you ever considered to solve Ethereums problems by seeing it as a second layer of an even more fundamental network?  
&gt;  
&gt;This is exactly the strategy the IOTA foundation revealed with its recent IOTA smart contract protocol (ISCP) beta release.  
&gt;  
&gt;They made the unique decision to have smart contracts not as a part of their feeless base-layer (the “Tangle”), but instead as a second layer solution. Each smart contract is one individual blockchain and is run by its own committee of nodes. This committee performs all smart contract computations internally and connects to the IOTA main-layer to create and send digital assets (NFTs, wrapped tokens, etc.) IOTA tokens and to communicate seamlessly with all other IOTA smart contract chains.  
&gt;  
&gt;This layout allows IOTA smart contracts to be extremely flexible in design, different for each usecase and each user, while bein extremely scalable. It is the antithesis of the “one blockchain fits all” paradigm, a true cooperative multi-blockchain environment.  
&gt;  
&gt;**IOTA smart contract chain can choose freely between:**  
&gt;  
&gt;\- **Permissionless** (for high decentralization) **or permissioned** (for trusted consortia) validators  
&gt;  
&gt;\- **PoW, PoS, PoX** or any other consensus mechanism  
&gt;  
&gt;\- **Being feeless or getting paid in any currency** (outside of the network in fiat or other crypto currencies, with a currency minted inside your IOTA smart contract blockchain (i.e. ETH) or with the native IOTA token)  
&gt;  
&gt;\- **Creating own internal tokens** (IOTA smart contract chains are complete blockchains after all)  
&gt;  
&gt;\- **Communicate feeless and seamlessly with other SCs over the IOTA Tangle.** You can interact with other smart contracts, build complex multi-SC networks and send around data, L2 tokens (i.e. ETH) or IOTA-based L1 token to every other connected SC chain.  
&gt;  
&gt;\- **Control IOTA tokens and IOTA digital assets on the Tangle**  
&gt;  
&gt;\- **Use any programming language you want** (currently supported Rust, Go and **Solidity (Ethereum virtual machine)**, many more languages and bridges planned).  
&gt;  
&gt;As you can see, IOTA smart contracts can be made in any way any company, government, DeFi developer, game-designer or private person would want them. It is a completely open playing field, a sandbox, ready to be flooded with ideas and use-cases.  
&gt;  
&gt;**The role of Ethereum in the IOTA smart contracts eco-system (“Apes together strong”)**  
&gt;  
&gt;IOTA is not an Ethereum-killer, it is an Ethereum enabler.  
&gt;  
&gt;Ethereum is plagued by unpredictable fees and a clogged network because every single Banano -&gt; Squirtle-coin swap needs to be processed by this literal world-computer. Every crypto-kitty, gambling-app or other fun little smart-contract project today gets secured with the insane levels of hash-power a literal world-computer has to offer and in turn becomes slow and expensive. Yes, there is a thing as having TO MUCH security for your crypto application and your latest gambling roulette or smart-neighborhood application in a suburb of Buenos Aires is a prime example for that.  
&gt;  
&gt;All these smaller and mid-size use-cases can now migrate onto the IOTA Tangle (IOTA 2.0 DevNet for now, mainnet next year) by creating their own, individual smart contract chains. Decentralized finance can for example be performed by smaller consortia using proof of stake on an individual smart contract chain. Gaming apps can be processed by just some dozens of validators instead of hundreds of thousands. Both speed and costs of DEXes would improve DRAMATICALLY – no more 100$ swaps that take one hour! We are talking DeFi happening in seconds and for the cost of mere cents.  
&gt;  
&gt;**So what´s the role of Ethereum here?**  
&gt;  
&gt;In this new context Ethereum can be seen the most decentralized and highest security IOTA smart contract chain possible. It will be the go-to solution for REALLY high stake smart contracts like high value life-insurances or large real-estate trades.  
&gt;  
&gt;Ethereum gains from being part of IOTA smart contract landscape:  
&gt;  
&gt;\- High reliability and use-ability for high-value use-cases because it is less clogged by smaller projects and games  
&gt;  
&gt;\- Seamless communication with ALL OTHER smart contracts on IOTA, even those which are impossible on Ethereum as of today (such as permissioned smart contracts by industry consortia)  
&gt;  
&gt;\- A more diversified and therefore decentralized crypto-landscape, no single point-of-failure  
&gt;  
&gt;Growth of the cryptocurrency space can only happen when technology evolves and projects work together – not “kill” each other. This is now possible in a previously unknown new direction: Not by adding second layers on top of Ethereum, but instead adding a “**Layer 0**” solution under its feet.",0,"Layer 0 - The real reason why Dominik Schiener, Co-founder IOTA Foundation said “IOTA is NOT an Ethereum killer”"

I’m genuinely curious about SHIB, it has zero utility that I can see, and it making huge gains, but the chart is not typical of a shitcoin rugpull. 

It’s really interesting to see how much money is being spent on this project. The daily amount of SHIB traded has blown away other meme/shit coins and has created a new pattern that doesn’t follow any other.

Sopongebob123,"I think I found that group randomly on Instagram where they have just a couple of followers but when I checked their Telegram, I was quite shocked to see 150k members there. As I try to experience all the possible things you can do in the crypto space, I naturally joined to see how that process work. Here is a short summary of the annoying journey. 

&amp;#x200B;

**When?**

The group doesn't allow any comments besides their own announcements. These announcements have a very simple order. They tell you when will the next pump happen and then they send several reminders as you're getting closer to the pump day. I think that they do these pumps around 2-3 times per week or something like every three days.

&amp;#x200B;

**How?**

There is a set time for when the pump starts. On the exact time and day it was planned, the announcement will display a simple message that just states the specific token's symbol. That seems to always happen at 6pm UK time and at the very second this happens, the price skyrockets. That only lasts for about a minute. For another minute the price hovers around the same high price and then it starts to drop hard basically to the pre-pump price. The owners of the group state something like that they ""hold the pump for two minutes to attract outside investors"", but I think that's just a clever statement how to screw over a lot of people. I will come back to this in the conclusion below.

&amp;#x200B;

**Where?**

So all of this happens at Hotbit exchange which I've never used before and it just look so bad. I'm sure there is a very good (shady) reason why the pump group uses this exchange but I don't know the details so feel free to expand on this!

&amp;#x200B;

**My own experience**

I prepared around 28 USDT and sent it to Hotbit (I did that by swapping it around with XLM to save on gas fees). I had the Exchange tab at Hotbit ready and Telegram opened on my phone, waiting for the ""signal"". As soon as the token symbol was revealed, I typed it to the search tab and tried to swap all my USDT as the price was immediately climbing high too fast. The price per token before the pump was $0.0038. My trade went through 19 seconds after the pump started when the price already grew 1000% to $0.039! I didn't really know what to do because the interface of Hotbit is so bad but I knew if I will hold longer than another few seconds, I will be screwed. I quickly sold everything at $0.051 (highest point of the pump was $0.06) making around $10 profit.

&amp;#x200B;

**Conclusion**

Sounds good? Actually not at all! It only took few seconds for the price to reach the top which means if your trade goes through just a little bit late, you will buy at the top and watch your money lose 10x of its value in the next minute. Obviously there must be a shit ton of people who already know which coin will be pumped and all the small flies like me only help them to pump it more. I think that the statement about ""attracting outside investors"" is just bs because the price wouldn't drop back to the original value if there were more people outside of the group buying.

If you want to play around and risk with your money, this is a fun thing to try out but remember you can easily end up with $100 worth of shitcoin after putting in $1000. You will definitely never be able to buy fast enough to get those 1100% profits so don't let that blind you. I was super lucky and got out with like 30% profit? I'm sure that's just because I put in a small amount of USDT. Was that like 10k USDT, the trade might have been executed at the top and I would turn into a clown 🤡

OfficialNewMoonville,"Fantom has been one of the outstanding emerging stars since the summer, and has already more than 10Xed since August. With the Fantom Developer Conference currently getting started in Dubai, and a real possibly of some big Halloween pumps on the horizon, I'd like to introduce the Fantom ecosystem and hopefully help some people who are getting started for the first time. 

# Why Fantom? 

There is a lot to like about Fantom, but one of the main draws at the moment seems to be the ultra-low gas fees and super fast transaction speeds. Fantom represents a great alternative for retail investors to get started in DeFi, given the current cost barriers for the average investor in the Ethereum network. Earlier this year Fantom transfers and smart contact interactions cost less than a cent to approve. Despite the gas fees rising substantially since then, as the network gains in popularity and Fantom moons, you can still make transactions for pennies. 

Most importantly, Fantom enabled retail investors to actually use their coins. Gas fees are *absurdly cheap* and *wicked fast*. Right now they are the highest they've ever been and it still cost less than ten cents to move stuff around. Usually it costs pennies.

# Where Can I Buy Fantom? 

Fantom is currently avaliable on Binance, KuCoin, FTX, Gemini, SushiSwap, Crypto.com, and many other exchanges. Not listed on CoinBase yet but it seems like it is only a matter of time. 

If you buy Fantom on Binance you can move your coins off of the exchange and to your private wallet for the low low cost of 0.01 FTM.

# The Official Fantom Wallet 

You can get the [Official Fantom Wallet here.](https://fantom.foundation/wallets/?__cf_chl_jschl_tk__=pmd_yuxqSPn39nlYkpMJspC_u4bKDepvZww_IaApnN5v.4I-1633646961-0-gqNtZGzNAfujcnBszQj9) Might look a bit old-school at the moment but this is still V1 and it is rumored to be getting an upgrade very soon, possibly to be announced this week at the Fantom Developer Conference. Official Fantom Wallet allows you to stake your FTM for some pretty impressive staking rewards (can be 10% plus if you don't mind looking it for a significant period). 

# Configuring MetaMask 

[This blog post here](https://www.weirdo.rocks/blog/tutorial-how-to-setup-fantom-ftm-on-metamask-and-get-started#toc-add-the-fantom-opera-network-to-your-metamask) enables you to set up your MetaMask wallet to join the Fantom Ecosystem in a relatively easy and painless procedure. 

**Step 1: Log in to your Metamask **

Login as usual. 


**Step 2: Select Custom RPC **


**Step 3: Fill the fields and Save **


 Network Name: Fantom Opera 

• New RPC Url: https://rpcapi.fantom.network 

• ChainID: 250 

• Symbol: FTM 

• Block Explorer URL: https://ftmscan.com/ 


**Step 4: Send Yourself Some Fantom **

# SpookySwap (BOO) 

Right now the undisputed star of the Fantom eco-system is [SpookySwap](https://spookyswap.finance/), an all-in-one DEX that allows users to swap tokens, provide liquidity, yield farm, stake their tokens and bridge tokens between the Fantom network and others. SpookySwap is also releasing an official NFT collection at the end of this month, if that is your thing. 

The Native SpookySwap token, BOO, has a max supply of 13,600,000, of which more than half are already circulating. It is currently ranked 396th by MarketCap, according to CoinGecko. BOO can be staked on the SpookySwap app with APRs in the 34-54% range, with 23.15% APR made in BOO and a further variable amount paid in a token of your choosing (I get an extra 19.9% paid in DAI). 

If SpookySwap doesn't grab you, maybe take a look at [Spirit Swap, the SpookySwap rival.](https://app.spiritswap.finance/)

# Tarot 

Tarot is a decentralized lending protocol where users can participate as lenders or borrowers in isolated lending pools. By supplying the pools in Tarot you can get APRs of up to 30% on FTM (as of right now), and up to 120% on the Native token Tarot, which can count Andre Cronje and [Vitalik Buterin himself](https://mobile.twitter.com/Jacktheoiler/status/1451140690734321669?s=20) among the current users.

Tarot has a market cap of less than $25,000,000 right now, despite $200,000,000+ in Total Value Locked on Tarot right now. 

The project is still in its early days, so if the UI doesn't grab you, you can try alternatives such as Abracadabra (SPELL) and Mushrooms.Finance (MM).

# The Future 

Fantom is a very new and rapidly evolving ecosystem, so there is a lot more to discover, including NFT platforms, staking and yield farming solutions, the works. In my opinion the best thing about using the Fantom Network right now is being able to discover DeFi without paying Ethereum prices. Although it is certainly a bit harder than buying coins to leave on exchanges and speculate with, it has really opened my eyes to what is possible when we actually use our coins and move them around. 

Good luck getting started. And credit to u/JasonLuxton and u/TonyBarnaby for getting me started on the Fantom Ecosystem myself.

Diatery,"Irish company Domila Limited is working with the University of Guadalajara on a pilot crypto project called Hoozies, which has legit ties to the IEEE as part of a 5G Smart Cities initiative. It's unclear how many businesses are participating on the pilot program, but the press release says over 1,800 users have signed up for the Hoozie app (Android, iOS) and 1.2 million pesos have been contributed for it's development.  

Here's how it works:

&gt;Hoozies can also be earned through the use of public transport, running and cycling. Riding a bike for 30 minutes, for example, earns a hoozie app user 10 hoozies. People get 50 hoozies if they sign up a friend to the app and 100 if they sign up a business.  
&gt;  
&gt;When people use the digital currency to make purchases in participating businesses, 4% of the value of the transaction is returned to them in hoozies.

It also works as a P2P / B2B app where you can sell your services and pay people directly through the app. There's some cashback campaigns for flocking to participating businesses.

What's unclear is what blockchain technology is under the hood, and whether or not we'll see Hoozies on exchanges any time soon.  Here's the most technical thing I could find about it: 

"" This project is promoted by the quadruple helix, composed by the SICyT through the COECYTJAL; by the technological firm HP, the Office of Visitors and Conventions (OFVC), ANTAD, the University of Guadalajara (UdeG), the innovation ecosystem of the European community represented by the company DOMILA LTD (Ireland), as well as by international associations as the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE IoT Smart Cities), being the world's largest organization in technology.  ""

Furthermore, in an interview the project leader Joel Myers said Hoozies technically isn't a cryptocurrency since it is pegged to the local currency... which is interesting. That reminds me of all of those godforsaken 90's internet payment dot-com bombs like Beenz and Flooz, which failed miserably.  You'd think they'd have consulted UrbanDictionary first, which has a colorful alternative definition. However, in a different interview Myers also says it uses blockchain technology. So which is it? This is like a more well thought-out version of El Salvador, but more centralized and dorky but wholesome.

SHIB could potentially reach an 80 Billion Dollar Market Cap within the next few months (.0002 per coin) and potentially 320 BILLION Dollar Market Cap by 2023 (.0008 per coin).

This is based off of Dogecoin’s previous market cap high of 80 Billion Dollars, that it reached back earlier this year. The bullrun has continued and Shiba Inu has overtaken Dogecoin in terms of popularity. Based on social media metrics, Shiba Inu is now one of the most popular cryptocurrencies with more mentions on Reddit and Twitter than Dogecoin (SHIB Gets More Mentions on Twitter Than Bitcoin, Ethereum, DOGE - ELEVENEWS).

There’s no reason Shiba can’t rise to Doge’s previous all time market cap high. The market cap for the whole crypto space is also expected to reach 10 Trillion Dollars by 2023 (https://bitcoinist.com/usd-10-trillion-total-crypto-market-cap/) and it currently stands at 2.55 Trillion. Going by some simple math. An all time Shiba MC high of $80 billion x 4x(Entire MC growth by 2023), we could see .0008 per coin within 2 years.

This is just based off of optimistic fundamental conditions that have occurred with Doge and could possibly happen with expected market growth.

The real hopium is where people may FOMO in the crypto space and Shiba makes it to the top 5 coins. If that were to happen that I don’t see why .001 wouldn’t be possible within a year. The growth and speed of growth of cryptocurrency is accelerating so quickly. Community burns of Shiba combined with people locking up their coin supply (by staking) could accelerate the price and market cap increase.

This is all incredibly optimistic thinking but it’s possible. If a pizza 12 or so years ago now costs $700 million, anything could happen... ;-)",0,SHIBA Could Potentially Reach A $320 Billion MC By 2023
AjScharni1,"This last week I had turned 18 and decided to start investing my money in stocks and crypto currencies. I am a freshmen in college with no current mode of income. Other than the money that I have already invested I have a little over 2,000 in a checking account that I want to invest(I do not need this money for necessities, all of it can be invested).

With my current situation I set up a Coinbase pro account. I am using Coinbase pro because I had read the fees would be cheaper than a standard Coinbase account. I plan to invest about 20-50 every week or every other week in stable coins like ETH and BTC. Correct me if I am wrong but this is what I have come to understand as dollar cost averaging and is a relatively safe investment strategy - feel free to critique.

In addition to the Coinbase pro account I know I also need a wallet, although I am not exactly sure why.

If you have any recommendations for a wallet that I should set up please let me know why it is necessary. Also any input regarding my investment strategy would be greatly appreciated. I plan to have an internship next semester and will be sure to change my investment strategy then when I have a consistent mode of income, but until then this is what I am planning on doing.",0,Getting started in crypto
Nervous_Sky_5167,"Tl;dr: The post talking about crypto supply centralization and how only a minute minority own a vast majority of coins is extremely misleading. They go on to claim how this is a 'core principle of economics' and how coin supply centralization is an incredibly precise indicator. Not to mention the title is full of spelling mistakes...

If you haven't seen what I mean, here's their post: [https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/qetjrx/the\_terrifying\_of\_totaly\_supply\_of/](https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/qetjrx/the_terrifying_of_totaly_supply_of/)

Now here's why coin supply centralization doesn't dictate everything about a coin:

**Selective Age Bias** \- As a cryptocurrency gets older and more mature, supply is offloaded from whales to other people. That is how basic money flow works. As time passes on, supply tends to get more evened out as that select cryptocurrency gets most expensive to accumulate, both from a literal and opportunity cost standpoint. This is why the cryptocurrencies that are older tend to have less coin supply centralization (i.e. ETH or the oldest of them all, BTC).

**Selective Exchange Bias** \- Another part of selective bias comes from exchanges. Older and more established cryptocurrencies tend to have more self-custody audiences (i.e. ETH or BTC). Newer or more speculative cryptocurrencies tend to exist mainly on exchange accounts, which show up as one centralized wallet (i.e. SHIB).

**Pseudo-anonymity** \- Most cryptocurrency wallets have no name or organization name, but despite the open-blockchain aspect, are known as 'pseudo-anonymous networks. Because of this, you cannot know whether the whale wallet you're looking at is a *centralized exchange wallet (i.e. Coinbase), fund wallet (i.e. private funds),* or an actual *personal* wallet (*my wallet)*. You also don't know whether a single person owns multiple wallets, their balances spread across them all in order to deter suspicion, or if multiple people own a single wallet (i.e. multi-sig wallet). 

I'm not here to root for any specific cryptocurrency. I just want to prove the facts, facts that the previous OP glossed over. There's a reason why the examples I just listed are mostly under *selective bias* psychology, and that's because the previous OP was probably cherry-picking details to mastermind his own ideals. 

It's kinda sad how that post was up-voted to high heaven since nobody really took any care in analyzing the details. Speaks volume of our echo-chamber subreddit.",0,One of the top posts about crypto supply centralization is misleading and outright lying.
alivellani,"Just knowing how much of a coin you have is not enough.

1. Date of purchase
2. Qty coins bought
3. Rate of the coin
4. Misc charges like fees etc
5. Total cost = ( rate * qty) + misc charges of the purchase.

InevitableSoundOf,"So NFT's have really taken off this year, and it's not unusual to hear about traders moving into the nft space because that's where the real money is. Fair enough, and each unto their own, but I'd thought I'd share a typical grift NFT market places use to maximize profits.

Person A, let's call them Shill9000. A 200k subscriber Youtuber, a typical Crypto Bro that even though preachers people need to be careful somehow still claims they're selling their bags for a new crypto project every week.

Person B, let's call them RealShady. A large NFT marketplace or crypto entity that has basically an endless supply of NFT.

RealShady needs more profits. They reach out to Shill9000 and say hey if you just advertise buying and selling a specific NFT for us we will give you 20k, and if it goes well expect this to be ongoing.

Shill9000 goes yeah sure, I like money.

RealShady sends 100k in whatever coin to Shill9000 with instructions to buy NotWorthADollar NFT. Shill9000 makes a new video with them buying a NFT for 100k (forgets to mention it's not with his money, or that the seller is RealShady). Cue cringe YouTube thumbnail. Shill9000 then makes a new video of them selling said NFT for 120k!!! Needless to say the video gets alot of views.

RealShady meanwhile has just brought NotWorthADollar NFT back for 120k through an unconnected account. Effectively giving Shill9000 a 20k payment. What they have also done is convinced a large amount of people that these types of NFT's are worth alot of money and more importantly that you can quickly sell them for a nice windfall.

Those watchers through no fault of their own now talk to friends and social media and the news further spreads. ""Hey I have inside information that X style NFT is where the money is at"".

Now RealShady sits back and watches as most of them get snapped up. Most for a much lower price then 120k but that's part of the con, as they aren't worth anything so convincing people 2k is cheap is the win. All of them being owned by them until the copycats arrive means RealShady has made alot more than 20k it cost to engineer the hype. 

In the hype some can be easily sold for the ridiculous price but in a month or two alot of people will be just bag holders with unprofitable NFT's.

RealShady then starts it all over again.

I don't have anything against NFT's but you just need to be aware of the space. I'm sure some people make money but yeah these engineered buy and sells are definitely a common occurrence in the space.

crua9,"So something that appears to be within the rules at this second but is talk about being against the rules possibly next year on. It's using wash sells to deduct from taxes. Note there is no clear answer if prior wash sells before the ruling will be allowed to use as a deduction or if they wont count for future deductions.

Anyways, what is a wash sell. More than less it is when you sell at a loss, and then rebuy within 30 days.

So where does this link to grid bots. If you're on LIFO then this doesn't matter. But since places like koinly, CoinTracker, and other places do a universal LIFO or FIFO. This most likely is a problem for the many. Like if you can find a tracker that let's you change it per sell then let me know.

Anyways, how a grid bot works is basically you have an upper and lower limit. You sat per grid buy/sell x amount of coins (for example 100 coins). And it does it. When it moves up and crosses grids it sells and it buys as it moves down.

Now the problem comes in when let's say $5 it buys $4 it buy $3 and $2. Then it goes from $2 to $3 and it sells. With FIFO the tax will look at it as you sold the coins you bought at $5. So it will be a loss. And now the price drop back to $2. Now it bought and this is where your wash sell came in.

(what makes it worse when it hits $5 it will have a massive gain. So this means you will pay taxes on massive gains while having massive losses. And if the wash sell rule is in place, you can't deduct any of the loss. Which means you now have a major major tax bill. But even if the wash rule isn't in place. You can only deduct $3k a year. And this means you again are stuck paying a ton more in taxes than you should.)


I learned this the hard way. This problem looks like it will cost me about 3 to 4 times more in taxes than I should've. But since I'm poor and can't afford a CPA. I'm pretty much screwed.


But note giving the wash sell rule never takes place and you make enough to pay for everything including a good cpa. I think this is worth it still. But for us poor folks. Idk

RatherCynical,"With another dog-based meme-coin reaching new ATHs and entering #10 soon, this post is a reminder that meme-based shitcoins aren't actually investing. It's much, much closer to gambling.

If the hype dies down, and the floor gives out, there isn't really a limit on how hard the price can fall. There are not enough buyers on the other side when the whales have made their money and decide to cash out. It's pretty cool for early investors to make a lot of money, but there will be many more ""investors"" who end up holding the bag.

God forbid, if you hold it through a 2018-style bear market, your bag could be an eternal bag.

If a shitcoin has a 95% chance of doing nothing - or worse - losing you money, and it has a 5% chance of giving you 1,000% returns, then overall your ""expected returns"" are 1,000% x 5% = 50%. You'd be much better off just buying and holding/staking some BTC and ETH.

There is a place for speculation within a portfolio. If you speculated with 10% of a portfolio on DOGE at $0.002, you would've made tremendous returns. Just never go all-in. There are much better projects out there that have a much better risk/reward profile.

Here is his PM to ME as follows:

[u/johnny\_kucoin](https://www.reddit.com/u/johnny_kucoin/)

Noted. Will discuss with the team

Also, noticed on the post you created. Here's our response FYI

Thanks for raising your question about KuCoin. As the People’s Exchange, we always pursue user satisfaction. Regarding the issues you mentioned, we are very willing to discuss them openly and transparently.

Firstly, Cloudflare is a world-renowned CDN solution. As you said, one of its main functions is to prevent DDoS attacks, which is also our main purpose for deploying it. Currently, almost all major exchanges are working closely with Cloudflare.

All exchanges have applied an access frequency limit through Cloudflare to ensure the stability of their services. Once the limit has been surpassed, denial of website access may occur. When setting the limit, we discussed thoroughly with high-frequency traders, like API traders, for instance, before concluding on the limit. We believe that in most cases, the frequency limit will not affect our users. But it is possible that, when there’s a big price move or someone visits the site too frequently, 504 pages may still appear due to the limitation. We have been working on improving this for a while, and if you encountered such an issue, we would appreciate it if you could share the RAY ID from the 504 pages with our support team so that we can better solve the problem. Thank you.

Secondly, regarding the AWS server, KuCoin invests a lot in IT infrastructure and network security. Compared with other exchanges of our size and scale, our investment in AWS servers is almost twice as much as theirs. And we will continue to invest in this sector as we know this is one of the fundamentals of our services.

In fact, as a platform, we care about usability and stability more than anyone else. The access issue will not only impact KuCoin's revenue but also affect user experience. As a platform dedicated to building itself and the industry for the long term, we know that reputation is everything. We hope that all users can trade with KuCoin easily and pleasantly, achieve their investment goals, and even improve their lives. As a neutral platform, we do not profit from users' liquidation. Therefore, we are constantly introducing new functions and educating users to help them manage their futures positions properly and reduce the risk of liquidation.

Having noticed that you’ve been banned in the KuCoin Subreddit, I am checking with the team for the reason, but our current guess is due to spamming. We have unbanned your account. All opinions are welcomed in our community, no matter if they are positive or negative. We are very sorry for the inconvenience. As for the Moderator List you claimed that we made private, actually we didn’t change any setting on that. It’s likely because banned users cannot see it. Please check again since you are now unbanned.

Since its establishment in 2017, we have experienced many ups and downs, but KuCoin always believes in the future of crypto. So, we will continue to invest in our system and strive to provide users with a better experience. I apologize again for the inconvenience. If you have any questions about KuCoin, our 24/7 customer support will always be there to help you out. If you are unhappy with their services, you can also DM me at any time, and I am very happy to help you. Thank you.

Here is my response

Johnny,

I am going to post this publicly so here is the TLDR summary

* You are running a business that solely functions on the web, and do a self proclaimed 1 billion in transactions a day.  

   * This is done without industry standard fail safes and protocols/ redundancy
   * You do this without informing the public of your audaciously poor risk management protocols.
* Your website, API’s, and app servers are going down and still processing orders on the backend  

   * Stop losses are not always triggering and the situation is not being made right
* Your website is not failing over
* There is ZERO fail safe or kill switch that cancels orders or suspends trades when the servers go down despite this being common industry practice)
* When the website does not fail over by design
* Cloudflare is being weaponized to deny access to the web server rather than failing over to a redundant gateway/ web server.
* Kucoin is knowing taking funds and keeping them when this happens
* All retail traders are sent to an endless customer service feedback look that gives them literally no resolution

You can elect to fix these issues and go back and actually settle all the funds that were literally stolen by Kucoin. Subsequently you can fix your technical architecture.

Anything less than this and you are playing politics and the community will see ZERO action on this matter.

\_\_\_\_\_\_

The extended answer to your response is as follows:

The one thing I will accuse you of publicly Johnny is being disingenuous. Let's stop the politics and get on with the resolution.

It's sad that it took my subreddit post on [r/Cryptocurrecy](https://www.reddit.com/r/Cryptocurrecy/) getting to the top of the subreddit for you to acknowledge the issue.

It's frankly disturbing I was instantly censored for publicly speaking up on this matter on [r/kucoin](https://www.reddit.com/r/kucoin/). I was not banned for “spam,” I am happy to review everyone of my posts with you to prove this.

I am not the only one that has been censored, there is a pattern of behavior surrounding Kucoins social media management to ban any counter perspective if it has weight.

On to the technical portion:

Everyone uses Cloudflare in almost every industry. It's good that you are using Cloudflare.

In your situation Cloudflare is not innocuous; it has been weaponized. Your Cloudflare settings and policy are such that it does not fail over to redundant infrastructure but treats retail traders as if they are doing a DDOS attack and denying access.

Why is Cloudflare denying access under Kucoins settings and policies? Liquidations are happening while people are still exhibiting and practising proper risk management protocols.

In our instance on September 7th we were intermittently denied access for 5 hours.

Cloudflare either accelerates or decelerates requests to recover or improve application and or web performance.

Cloudflare has the option to failover to redundant website gateways should your peak loads exceed their capability. For enterprise level websites such as Kucoin this is combined with a Ge load balancer that balances user loads to different gateways based of the users source IP and a ton of other policies that get add in in (these are too numerous to document here, I am happy to defer anyone to whitepapers on the matter).

In Kucoins instance they have consciously opted to not fail over website gateways. This means that users are being denied access as the only other viable option when your gateway goes down

To say everyone uses cloudflare as we do is also disingenuous.

For lack of a better metaphor, if you swing a hammer (Cloudflare) and hit some patrons, you can't turn to the crowd and say “hey folks it's just a hammer (Cloudflare)…. Everyone has one.”

To mention your Amazon AWS spend is also disingenuous:

By virtue of the fact you're not opting for a failover gateway and geo load balancing but still processing trades that result in liquidation while retail investors get locked out of their accounts is not ok.

Your IT spend is irrelevant.

You have a fiduciary duty and the trust of the community to tend to their funds and respect their trades. This trust is being violated and repainted as “an IT outage and then blame shifting to the retail trader themselves saying they need to exhibit better risk management.”

You don't get to lock people out of their house for several hours and subsequently burn the house to the ground and blame shift telling them to act more responsibly.

You have ZERO plausible deniability here!

I brought this to your attention personally as I also did with your help desk and our customer Rep Zoe.

Cloudflare and outages are keeping people from accessing their account. Their money is being taken, and Helpdesk sends them to an endless loop with no path of escalation. No one is getting their funds or crypto actually restored after an outage to the point previous to that very outage. Cloudflare is denying access rather than deferring to other gateways to handle the load.

This is by design, there is no plausible deniability as I have personally brought this to your attention as well as the help desk. Since that time there have been no less than 5-10 more outages resulting in more losses by the community.

You have 2 options on how to fix this issue (both of which should be implemented tied together)

* A kill switch (see below)
* Or failing over to a redundant gateway/ webhead and geo load balancing the load.

Again, you would still do both to protect the people

Kucoin has consciously made a choice to do neither after I repeatedly brought this up.

I repeat for emphasis here “You have no plausible deniability.”

**This puts Kucoin on par with Robinhood the app on how they removed AMC, GME, and Dogecoin buy/ sell functionality to benefit the exchanges needs.**

This is an old playbook that predates the Great Depression when banks would lock their doors so customers could not get to their funds for withdrawal to stop a run on the bank.

You are locking your doors via Cloud Flare and server outages stopping us from getting access to our property and breaching fiduciary duty in doing so.

I don't have data proving you have a liquidity issue but your behavior emulates the same issues demonstrated for literally hundreds of years.

Fix this shit immediately!

You can spend all the money on Amazon ( AWS) you want. It doesnt change the fact that your infrastructure prohibits people from accessing their account in times of need. You are locking the doors, stopping people, while putting Kucoin’s interests first

They are liquidated even when they follow proper risk management protocol. They are left powerless, and have no path of engagement to rectify the situation. IF it gets to you, you don't ever actually fix the situation but send every person back down the ladder.

Ask our account Rep Zoe. The person you personally directed us to, and did not deal with our issue either. We have been having this conversation for 2 months!

The situations are not rectified.

I am happy to post all of my emails and telegram messages to back up what I am saying here right now.

Your website could absolutely fail over to a redundant gateway and take on the concurrent load, but it doesn't do that by design (literally). If you can't handle the load then you need to have a kill switch that pauses all trading activity no different than the HKex, CME, and other major exchanges.

Anything less is a breach of fiduciary duty of Kucoin and you as an individual, and frankly spitting in the face of everyone who believed you and trusted you.

These are all measures that I brought to your and your team's attention. No action was taken but repeated outages have happened.

.

I am calling bullshit that you don't know the exchange is going down and that you don't know that people's funds are not getting restored.

I can post my messages with you and all the team right now to back up what I am saying.

The fact stands your website goes down and you knowingly take peoples money. It's never restored and they are sent to an endless loop of customer service until they submit the stolen funds to you.

There is no kill switch and your website does not failover. The OTC desk still processes Institutional orders ( whales) while putting the people of the “peoples exchange” on the menu for harvesting.

The only reason you are responding to me and lifting my ban from Kucoins subreddit is the “people” pulled together and put your company's reputation on the line.

That being said, you have an opportunity to right the situation at this very moment.

I will ask everyone to present their case and we publicly resolve these issues.

If your exchange can't handle the load all leveraged trades should be auto-cancelled without penalty and margin debt clocks are suspended with a path to restoration. Anything less than this and your words are mere words and not actions aka playing politics.

It's a de facto response from any broker/ exchange in a liquidity crisis to remove the buy/sell buttons or turn down the servers removing retail investor access.

Your website is removing retail access while still processing transactions and taking the hard earned funds of the community. No matter what you say this is the reality. It's calculated, it's methodical, and those funds are not being restored for more than 0.5% in a settlement best case scenario. The vast majority of users never have their funds restored.

Retail investors are literally being harvested by Kucoin.

This post is only round one of the screen shots, videos, scans and logs we have.

This is a point brought up several times on Reddit!

You are doing so with no failover or kill switch and exposing people to imminent risk and not informing them of your shody IT practices.

Yet when your website goes down it brings the API server and application server for the app down as well but you still manage to process orders on the back end via the OTC desk. To typically engage with an OTC desk the threshold is often 5 million to 35 million in assets.

So you are liquidating the little guy while providing white glove concierge service to whales.

I am calling you out on the carpet here and now asking you to do what you said you would do and repay those affected.

Subsequently fix your shit!

Lastly I want you to publicly answer one question

“Why did you remove the liquidation price from margin contracts and increase the liquidation risk of all retail traders??

\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*If you do not answer this question directly, I will publicly repeat it until you do.\*\*\*\*

You are taking away traders ability to manage risk and then accusing those same people of not managing risk when you liquidate them in an outage.

I am happy to keep sharing with the community what info I have on your environment and business practices “if Kucoin does not exercise proper risk management” and proper fiduciary duties.

This is round 1

RatherCynical,"This subreddit has a tendency to hate SHIB and DOGE and SAFEMOON a lot.

The problem with shitcoins is that a shitcoin isn't actually investing. It's much, much closer to gambling. If the hype dies down, and the floor gives out, there isn't really a limit on how hard the price can fall. There are not enough buyers on the other side when the whales have made their money and decide to cash out. It's pretty cool for early investors to make a lot of money, but there will be many more ""investors"" who end up holding the bag.

If a shitcoin has a 95% chance of doing nothing - or worse - losing you money, and it has a 5% chance of giving you 1,000% returns, then overall your ""expected returns"" are 1,000% x 5% = 50%. You'd literally be better off buying some BTC and ETH.

There is a place for speculation within a portfolio. If you speculated with 10-25% of a portfolio on DOGE at $0.002, you would've made tremendous returns. Just never go all-in. There are much better projects out there that have a much better risk profile.

Good luck investing, everyone. The next few months are going to be life-changing for many of y'all.",0,SHIB and other shitcoins.

Sentinel35P,"Last week, I had an ""afterwork"" convo about crypto with two colleagues whom I consider to be close friends.


I'm surprised that friend 1 is somewhat knowledgeable about crypto. He kept on repeating ADA, ALGO and some others as the having potentials. However, he is not invested at the moment. 


Friend 2 is somehow exposed to crypto by way of the Axie Infinity game where he is side-investing to his brother who has some scholars.


Anyway, our convo revolved in me discussing that it is the future, that we are still early, and the likes of thing spurned here in the sub. 


This kind of spiked the interest of friend 2 as he realized that he doesn't know much about crypto, except what he knew already in Axie.


As he had a lot of very specific questions, I told him about the concept of DYOR - Do your own research. I even told them about this sub and the community point system that is the Reddit Moons (which I have high hopes for the future, BTW). And I explained that I won't recommend any coin/token, except maybe to do his research on the top/blue chip like BTC and ETH.
Unknown to me, friend 2 entered the rabbit hole of crypto ""influencers"" on YT and FB. Last night, I received a message from friend 2, asking my opinion or though about Shiba Inu. It dragged me from my dreamy, sleepy state and woke me up. 


I said, just research on the concept of market cap and realize that it may not be up to what some people expects it to be, and that it is essentially a meme coin.
His answer horiffied me. He said, ""I invested in Shiba Inu and I have high hopes that it will surpass the 'dodge' coin. I think its too undervalued and it will reach 10USD.""


I said, you mean the Doge Coin, the one shilled be Elon Musk in the past? He said, yeah, that one. 


I was dumbfounded. I didn't expect a simple conversation last week will lead into this. But for all it's worth, he is in the green as we talked. This prompted me to tell him not invest in it in the long term.  Just know when to take profits and don't be greedy. I further explained the concept of market cap and why it is impossible for it to be at 10 USD (which was his initial target) in the future. The reason it's rallying at the moment is because of hype and also as aftereffects of the bullrun that we may be in rn.

The funny and somehow frustrating thing for me is the fact that he bought first then asked my opinion after. OMG!


The lesson here, I guess, and the piece of advice I learned, is to always be clear on what you say about cryptos when around friends and even families. Especially, explain to them that memecoins exist. Don't let them fall to FOMO. They may blame you later if they will get burned in the future. My friend just FOMO'ed in SHIBA INU after a brief convo with me. I may never get that off my head.",0,"After a brief convo about cryptos, my 'idiot' friend, invoking DYOR that I talked about, FOMO'ed in SHIBA INU"
TiredRightNowALot,"If you've been around crypto for a while, you know that your cryptocurrency wallet typically has a very long, strong set of words for the password / key.  The other thing you know is that people sometimes forget these words and lose access to their files.  That can be a frustrating thing.  It can also create internet legends, stories and ruin lives.

So why are they so difficult?  Well, that's because (in theory) you could have your entire life savings stored in crypto and then associated with this wallet.  Imagine having that password be easily cracked / guessed / stolen.  That wouldn't be good for anyone, including crypto as a technology.  Here are some examples of how hard passwords can be to crack with today's computers.

&amp;#x200B;

|Character Count|Lowercase Letters Only|Lower and Uppercase|Addition of numbers|Addition of symbols|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|8|5 seconds|22 minutes|1 hour|8 hours|
|9|2 minutes|19 hours|3 days|3 weeks|
|10|58 minutes|1 month|7 months|5 years|
|11|1 day|5 years|41 years|400 years|
|12|3 weeks|300 years|2000 years|34,000 years|

As you can see, the passwords get very difficult.  34,0000 years to guess 1LoveRedd1t! on average.  That's going to be a tough one.

Now, for a wallet seed phrase, let's say there are 12 random words.  There are a total of 2,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000 possible combinations of words.  This isn't something that even the most adventurous of hackers is going to try - it's not going to happen.

Searching for a reasonable explanation of time to guess this phrase is nearly impossible (to get a good answer).  But suffice to say, it's not going to happen until computers are running in some technology that we don't yet have (quantum computers aren't far off, to be fair).  One explanation I found states that if you were checking 1 Trillion combinations per second and ran the password cracker for 40 years, you'd be no where near 1% of the way through all of the combinations.  In fact, the math displayed shows that you would be this far:   0.000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000001%.  

**So why do people get their accounts hacked or stolen?**

Here are a few ways that people still lose their crypto (but not an all encompassing list)

1. Installing programs with a virus / keylogger
2. Accepting and air drop, invite or something from someone online that installs a program, runs a smart contract, or a slew of other exploits
3. Storing their password online in cloud storage (no point in storing your super secure 12 word seed phrase behind an 8 character password....)
4. Websites that are phishing for your data.  Enter your seed phrase here to sync your wallet and receive free shitcoin (this seems to happen more than I would have ever thought)

What to do....

1. Create a strong seed phrase (or write down the one given to you)
2. Write down your seed phrase physically and store it in a LOCKED and SAFE place
3. Store your seed phrase offline if you have to have it on USB or something else
4. NEVER enter your seed phrase online, ANYWHERE
5. Run a virus program, keep it up to do
6. Be skeptical and protect your information.

Amelie007,"Hi, I put a lot of effort into this and I hope it can help you or at least inform you in how to better protect your precious crypto from the most widely used attacks and scams out there.

**1. Phishing Attacks**: This involves clicking on a link that takes you to a fake website that resembles a legitimate site in order to get you to sign-in and steal your login credentials. An example would be getting an e-mail that looks legitimate, pretending to be from an exchange that you use, asking you to immediately secure your account because it has been compromised or something to that effect. In the subject of the e-mail a link is provided which you click but instead of taking you to the legitimate site it takes you to an identical fake website where you input your login credentials. In the process you hand over your details to the attacker, which proceeds to login to the legitimate site and drain your funds.

* *Best way to avoid these*: Bookmark the legitimate sites on your browser and only login to them directly from there, and never from an external link, always verify a site's security (making sure the site’s URL begins with “https” with a closed lock icon and check the security certificate as well).

**2. SIM swap attacks**: Spoofing someone's SMS is actually easier than most people think, and once an attacker can divert your SMS to their phone they can bypass 2FA checks, reset passwords and gain access to your accounts and everything linked to them.

* *Best way to avoid it*: Use an authenticator app as part of the 2FA process and disable SMS authentication.

**3. Clipboard hijack attack:** You get this from having malware on your device. If your device has been compromised with a clipboard snooper then an attacker can replace the crypto address you copied and replace it with its own address when you paste it (There are many forms of malware that monitor clipboard activity to detect if it contains a crypto address, then it automatically tampers with the receiving address)

* *Best way to avoid it*: Don't use pirated software, stick to legitimate operating systems, avoid illegal streams or questionable websites where you can get this type of malware. Use both an anti-virus and anti-malware program, do regular updates/scans and keep your OS updated to the latest security patches. Always double &amp; triple check the address you are sending your funds to.

^(\*1, 2 and 3 can easily be avoided by storing your crypto in cold storage (hardware wallet) where you have to confirm and authenticate every transaction.)

**4. Airdrop scams:** Airdrops are a legitimate way for new crypto projects to promote the launch of a new coin and boosting recognition for their token by distributing it to active members of a blockchain community. Unfortunately, sometimes they are scams, and the tokens cannot be transacted or swapped in any of the popular exchanges, asking you to claim them by going to a questionable site where they ask you to connect your wallet, input your seedphrase or send them gas fees in order to get them.

* *Best way to avoid it*: NEVER give your private keys to anyone or input your seedphrase to claim anything, always double check the legitimacy of the site where you connect your wallet, check [https://airdrops.io/](https://airdrops.io/) to see if the airdrops are legit. Spending money to make money doesn't apply here (Don't send gas fees in order to claim them, you won't get them back). And if something is asked of you, it will only be your wallet's PUBLIC address to see if you qualify.

**5. Greed scams:** A user 'inadvertently' and 'innocently' posts their recovery seed on social media, forums, reddit, etc. You being the 'good Samaritan' decide to recover your newly found wallet only to find out that you need to send ETH to be able to extract the ERC20 tokens, unfortunately for you as soon as you send the ETH there is an automated script that extracts it, leaving you ETH deficient and teaching you a lesson.

* *Best way to avoid it:* Don't be a greedy son of a bitch.

**6. Double your money scams:** A fraudster (maybe someone impersonating a famous person) asks you to send them 1 coin in order to get 2 coins back. Do I really need to explain this one? once you give away a coin, you should expect nothing back.

* *Best way to avoid it:* Ask yourself, would you give away 2 bitcoins in order to receive 1 bitcoin?

**7. Token scams:** Believe it or not, anyone can make a Token in less than 10 minutes and for less than $10 bucks, there are actually many apps out there that facilitate the creation of one. Because of this ease, there are many malicious contracts and rug pulls associated with the newest tokens on the market.

* *Best way to avoid it*: Go to [https://tokensniffer.com/](https://tokensniffer.com/) where you can check for yourself if the latest Token that was shilled to you is a scam.

brpintos,"Am I the only one who feels that all this NFT craze ain't gonna age well..?  
Let me elaborate, and remember, we are not discussing here the fundamentals of NFT's. NFT's will certainly have a place because of what they can offer, and because they're a better mousetrap, but hear me out;  


This all started with crypto art. All of a sudden all these youtubers start to dump video after video on NFTS and how this represents the great new opportunity, hyper gains, 100x, yada yada.   
And well, because misery loves company, crypto punks happened, bored apes happened, and a bunch of other ones. These ""black swans"" helped crystalize the idea that NFT art was an incredible investment.  
And although I'm far from being an expert on everything crypto, I know my ways around design and art, and that's why all this felt funky from the get-go.   
The art business exists since ever. And every one can buy art. Also, digital art business exists since the beginning of the internet. What irritates me, is this narrative that NFT's all of a sudden created all of these. As if before, any of these was possible.  
This has nothing to do with art, art business or ""digital copyrights"" - bored apes and crypto punks went crazy because of the narratives, hype and fomo. There's no intrinsic value to them.  


And because only crypto rich can play this game (buying 100 eths bored apes), now, guys like tony jnyr and others are creating more stupid and cheap NFT collections so us, the ""peasants"" can get in on the FOMO too. All of these will worth absolutely zero in a year, which means, a permanent loss.  


And now, because Jpg's are too ""september"", it's the game industry. Again, the same pattern.   
This is what Backer posted today on twitter:  


*""Given the choice, most humans would dramatically alter their appearance, surroundings, communities.  This is why we will live in a digital world and our digital identities will be worth more to us than our RL.*    
*Nfts are the first phase of “digital” self.""(*

This is just stupid and annoying. NFT's aren't the beginning of nothing in the game industry. Every single problem that nft's could solve, is already solved. Yes it can be faster and cheaper, and more robust, and cool, but that's it. ""Oh because now you can create your own skins and sell them and;"" CS is doing that for a freakin decade. The nerve these guys have, saying out loud things, like they know something that no one else knows; including game companies who hires the most talented people in the industry on multiple areas of expertise.  


And speaking on Metaverse, the Metaverse exists in this  format since Second Life; this was 20 years ago. We already had ""lindens"" to trade for usd, make payments and earn money. Any of this is new, as the matter a fact is old af.  
And guess where's second life now? Nowhere.   
Before talking about NFT's and Metaverse, these guys should be questioning if there's a need and a want for this ""Metaverse"" they're always praying about. But that wouldn't generate many likes and views, wouldn't it?  
They take us for stupid with their cool catchy phrases and riddles on twitter. I can't stand these guys anymore and this NFT's crap.",0,Am I the only one who feels that all this NFT craze ain't gonna age well..?

Wrong.

From their website:

"" Your digital marketing strategy is incomplete without content marketing, which is why getting it right is always imperative. Our marketing experts are capable of tailoring content so that it engages your target audience at every stage of their journey. ""

"" Growing your followers on social networks will help you increase word of mouth and referrals. We provide social media marketing services that enable you to reach relevant people, increase your following, make connections and drive organic traffic to your website with high success.""

Basically, the Coin Bureau channel is designed and curated to manipulate and influence your opinions on crypto for either clients of V3 digital or V3 digital itself. Essentially Coin Bureau is paid to shill the highest bidder. They want you buying their shitty hoodies and t-shirts while they cram misinformation and their agenda down your throat.

While millionaires constitute only a small percentage of the population, they hold substantial control over economic resources, with the most powerful and prominent individuals usually ranking among them. The total amount of money held by millionaires can equal the amount of money held by a far higher number of poor people. The Gini coefficient, and other measures in economics, estimated for each country, are useful for determining how many of the poorest people have the equivalent total wealth of the few richest in the country. Forbes and Fortune magazines maintain lists of people based on their net worth and are generally considered authorities on the subject. Forbes listed 1,645 dollar billionaires in 2014, with an aggregate net worth of $6.4 trillion, an increase from $5.4 trillion the previous year.[12] (see US-dollar billionaires in the world).

Sixteen percent of millionaires inherited their fortunes. Forty-seven percent of millionaires are business owners. Twenty-three percent of the world's millionaires got that way through paid work, consisting mostly of skilled professionals or managers.[13] Millionaires are, on average, 61 years old with $3.05 million in assets.[14]",0,Crypto that will 20x in the next 5 years

Portfolio goals for end of 2022: 65% real estate adding another rental, 30% retirement accts, 5% crypto.

After 2022 I would like to continue my increased crypto contributions to try to get my retirement to crypto ratio to 1:1. I’m hoping it won’t take too long with the way that crypto is outperforming index funds.

In one of the books it explained that investors (i.e. hodlers) have 1 strategy. It is to hodl and when it goes down, just hope it gets back up. This kinda summed up my last bear market. Traders however are more flexible and can even make money in a down market (in theorie).

So I worked on a trading strategy and I tried to automate it to keep the emotions out. When i backtest the strategy on tradingview it shows some nice results. It even beats the buy and hold results.

I currently use 1/8 of the value of my portfolio for trading, but I have a feeling to double down. If we enter into a bearmarket at some point my flexible 1/8th part probably surpasses my portfolio, so why not increase it.

A) start small and test it out a bit more (with the risk of losing gains)

B) Increase the trading amount. You have backtested it so just go for it.

Coinbase - also a rocksolid exchange (use pro for lower fees) It was my first exchange however kraken beats the shit out of it regarding fees.

Most people don't want to FOMO into a coin that costs $61,000 each, but when that's divided by a million?... Satoshis are only $0.061 each, with a maximum circulating supply of 21 Trillion coins!

The safest investment that I could see was converting to wrapped DAI which was DAI.e. There was only one site that would convert the AVAX to DAI.e, Trader Joe (should have been my second red flag). And then depositing my DAI.e, the yield was 18,000% APR, but they wanted a 4% deposit fee (should have been my third red flag), but I moved forward with the transaction. As the site went live, and farming began, I noticed that when you “harvested your yield” only 50% was sent to your wallet and 50% remained in your harvest amount until you were able to harvest again in 2 hours (should have been my fourth red flag). As the first 3 hours went by and I tried to capture great yields, the coin that was being harvested dropped from $3,400 to $430 and the yield went down greatly which was Tomato Coin (TMT), which also only had liquidity on the Yield Farming Site (definitely was my fifth red flag). After each harvest, there was a minimal gas fee to put the TMT token into my wallet.

📷

Even though Rugdocs.io listed the site as “Low Risk”, I became way since the APR yield was down from 18,000% APR to under 1,000% APR and the farmed coin continuously dropped hour by hour. I decided to pull my wrapped DAI out and convert it back to AVAX and then encountered not only a gas fee, but, a liquidity fee from Trader Joe (should have been my sixth red flag).

All in all, lost my 4% about $12, and gas/liquidity fees of $3 and AVAX price drop of $15. So, net net, my education cost me about $30. Moral of this story is, DYOR and I’ll coin another acronym for crypto (RTFP – Read The Fine Print), LOL.

However, not all is lost in this experience, included in my education was gaining the knowledge of how to set up an AVAX wallet, convert from AVAX X chain to C chain, send from AVAX wallet to MM wallet, connect to farm site, convert to wrapped coins, and play the yield game.

Lastly, do not be illusioned or have BIG Hopium on some of these projects, study them carefully – even though I lost $30, I’m a lot wiser today. Reckon I’ll miss a Happy Hour or two out with my buddies as a result 😊",0,Yield Farming 101 Education - It Did Not End Well
CanChillorNoCanChill," This is merely a theory of sorts. But in news a while back, A Crypto Whale purchased $43,838,916 USD of crypto token SHIB (9/30/2021). Being a bag holder of roughly 6 Trillion SHIB (6,178,758,122,373 tokens) 

Now If this anonymous individual resides in the USA, and were to pay Capital Gains taxes. It is possible for this one individual to pay off US Governments debt. Which currently is above $28 Trillion.

To make things easier, let’s just stick with the Federal Short Term Capital Gains tax of 37%. (Basically anybody whose Income is over $523K\~). And for the purpose of this theory, we will just sell the whole bag. 

That being said the recent ATH $0.00004432 would have turned this person’s $43 Million into $273 million. And if cashed for USD, would pay $129 Million in taxes ($128,940,285).  

If the market price is $0.00016185 it would make this $43 Million investment into $1 Trillion dollars. And be taxed at $397 Million ($397,630,435)

So what does the market price of SHIB need to be for this person to pay 28T in taxes? 

The market price of SHIB would need to be $0.0125. 

The total of this bag would become $77 Trillion (77,234,492,818) and when taxed at 37%, pay 28 Trillion ($28,604,380,860). 

This individual investor could literally wipe out most of the US Governments debt at that point. 

The Power of Crypto will move and change Governments. 

&amp;#x200B;

**TLDR:** When the price of SHIB hits $0.0125, a Crypto Whale can pay of the US Governments $28 trillion debt with just their taxes alone. Because of math.",0,Theory: How a Single Crypto Whale can get rid of $28T of US Government debt

|19|999|2.92|0.00|0%|
|20|LINK|1.81|29.32|1620%​|

As can be seen, simply putting $500 into BTC and $500 into ETH gain a remarkable results at $18,953. Or if you put $1,000 into ETH now you will be sitting on $29,729.

Diversification doesn't always work in crypto, though. The returns for top 5, top 10, top 20 are all lower than $18,953, hovering just around $10,000.

|$1,000 invested in|Crypto|
:--|--:|
|Top 2|$18,953.43|
|Top 5|$9,422.81|
|Top 10|$9,365.48|
|Top 20|$10,576.64|
|Best - top 20|$61,059.91​|

However, it is worth noting that one coin in the top 20 actually returns $61,060 (ADA). Some significant returns are also observed with BNB (3,261%) and LINK (1,520%). There is also a coin that is worth $0 today (999). If I dig through for lower cap coins back in 2020, I'm sure I can find some even more jaw dropping returns, however chances are huge that you might pick up a lemon or worse, a 999.

Now let's compare to another popular investment option.

**Stock**

Stocks of most major companies doubled in value in those 20 months. However returns on index such as NASDAQ or S&amp;P 500 are lower (67% and 40% respectively).

The largest outlier is Tesla. The $1,000 invested in Tesla stock back then would be worth $10,572.

Agreeable_Baby2328,"I’m real interested in this concept of market cap limiting the growth potential of coins. Cause it sounds reasonable. So I did some extremely quick, easily could be wrong, research on the historical data of ETH and BTC. 

I chose these for two reasons:
1. We all know where they are at today and we wouldn’t have suspected it in 2015. 
2. I hear a lot of people saying to others things like, “do you really think _____ coin will surpass BTC?!?!”

August 2015 - ETH

$1.26 x 72,000,000 circulating = $90,720,000 MC

$227.18 x 72,000,000 = $16,356,960,000 MC


August 2015 - BTC

227.18 x 14.55M circulating = $3,305,469,000 MC

So by the same 2021 logic, a person could have grabbed $100 worth of ETH at $1.26. At the time BTC was at $227.18. They would have dreamed their ETH hit the same BTC price. 

Would Reddit have swooped in and told them how crazy they were to think it would be greater than BTC? 

If not, then why is this a metric to valuation future value?

If so, please explain, I’m genuinely curious as I start doing more research.

I have about $6000 in Fantom currently, it's sitting as collateral on geist.finance . I'm very happy with Fantom but kind of disappointed in geist.

I have about $3000 in stablecoins. Mostly USDT. Why would anyone hold stablecoins? And as 20% of my portfolio too? Two reasons: First, that's the money I have already on ramped that is waiting for a good dip or buying opportunity to present itself. Second, I have it earning about 20-25%. The way that I am earning 20+% on stablecoins is via liquidity pools. Specifically I take USDT and add it to the USDT/USDC/DAI liquidity pool on avax.curve.fi  Liquidity pools create a trading platform for people that need to swap from one token to another. Double stable/ triple stable pools are my personal favorite for holding assets because they don't have a risk of impermanent loss. Your assets are used and people pay a fee to the LP and you get a share of the fee. In this case curve is paying 4% APY directly  and an additional 20% in AVAX to people that fund that pool since it's in demand. Since I believe in the long term value of AVAX I am holding that income. If I didn't have faith in AVAX I would just cash it out.

I thought that the main key that cryptocurrency is unique of is decentralization. Then what about BNB? Their ecosystem’s tech is literally ctrl+c ctrl+v of Ethereum’s. With one extra point. Throw in the mix 1 CEO and company. Funny thing is that the CEO of bnb has been making a disparage remarks about Ethereum, yet they copied their hard work which took years to do. They are completely centralised but make themselves seem decentralized.

Yeah, I understand, the eth fees are so expensive that many switched to Binance Smart Chain. But isn’t this what crypto is against the whole time? Doesn’t crypto wanted to avoid this? Isn’t crypto feared of this and fighted against it for years? We rememba Solana shutting off whole network, many cryptos are basically owned by 10-15 people... list goes on and on..

ArtofZed,"As Bitcoin continues its October rally, news from the regulatory world is also creating bullish sentiment. Neither the SEC nor the IMF are calling for a crypto ban; instead, both organizations are advocating regulation. Good news is also coming from Germany and the President of Ukraine remains a crypto friend as well. Last week's Regulatory ECHO.

**SEC chief opposes crypto ban....**

After China's crypto ban, the guardians:inside of the US financial system have to take a stand. Because after the head of the U.S. central bank Fed, Jerome Powell, already spoke out against a ban on cryptocurrencies, Gary Gensler followed suit last week. At a hearing before the U.S. Congress on October 5, the head of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) distanced himself from the approach of the government in Beijing. 

According to Gensler, regulatory efforts rather have an integrative task. It is important to ensure that the crypto space is integrated into the financial system, for example in terms of consumer protection and tax law. A ban on Bitcoin is also not within the SEC's remit.

Not only the SEC, but also the International Monetary Fund (IMF) recently took a stand on cryptocurrencies. On October 3, the organization published a report discussing crypto-related opportunities and risks for developing countries. On the one hand, the IMF acknowledges there that Bitcoin and blockchain technology open up potential for more inclusive financial services. 

However, according to the report, increasing adoption could also threaten financial stability in developing countries in the future. For example, if citizens prefer Bitcoin to local currencies that are weakened by inflation. In the long term, this would undermine the respective central bank and open up loopholes for tax evasion. To counter such capital outflows, the IMF calls for international standards in crypto regulation.

In addition, the judicial officials will provide information about digital currencies even before the auction. For this purpose, Markus Hartmann, together with public prosecutor Andreas Brück, will give a brief insight into the typical offense fields of cryptocurrencies. In addition, the two explain how the ZAC NRW deals with it. The website was not created specifically to auction bitcoin, but cryptocurrencies already have their own category on it.

Guys my first post! been here for about less than a year, and I think one of the most common used terms goes to DYOR, which makes sense as a key aspect to crypto, and overall life.

The more I get into crypto the more I’m 
 interested into learning more. Talking about learning basic aspects, interesting projects, useful or relevant news etc.

But so far I haven’t found consistent sites/ people to, and anyways I thought I’d be interesting if you guys share your favorite places on where.

 I know this is a subjective matter, but if enough people share their thoughts it’s possible to then DYOR and contrast from the different persons and sites they research from. Even YouTube, while I do know it’s not a likely place to research (Not looking for any guru) I believe that there might be people who do share some useful information.

throwawaycosreasons2,"I’ve been following WonderHero for a while. It’s a crypto RPG game for mobile. The art and website looked good, the whitepaper seemed legit, and most of the team are doxxed. But most importantly, the game looked fun and well-produced.

Its IDO launched a few days ago on Polkastarter which claims to have a “rigorous and thorough” vetting process. Well that can’t be true, because its WND token [fails](https://tokensniffer.com/token/0xb2aa453b56b495cb95bc9fa72e7706b84e41ee54) the sniff test. At least 95% of its liquidity is controlled by an unlocked wallet (HINT: possible rugpull, see poocoin) and the game, trailer and art has been ripped from a game launched in China, Japan, Korea, and in English: 战场英雄物语/Battle Star. It at least dates back to 2017. Of course, there is currently no mention of this on the WonderHero website or whitepaper.

DetroitMotorShow,"A lot of projects are just once again following the same pattern from 2017 when it comes to raising funds. Allocate an initial big % of funds to VCs, key backers at a ridiculously cheap valuation while the project is not even in the public eye, then build some of the features of the project (usually a website, a DEX or couple of pools/farms) and then create a big marketing hyped launch event, where around 10% of the project's tokens can be bought by the public. Meanwhile, 90% of the tokens are controlled by insiders and VCs who entered at 1/100th the price. 

&amp;#x200B;

[Price during deposit perion: $27. Price for VCs: 22c](https://preview.redd.it/uily92gf9gv71.jpg?width=1125&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=12a1516e1496dc9524064c4a49ed13484300e700)

This is nothing short of a scam, but this market always drags in the next sucker who thinks they can profit by becoming a ""long term investor"" in these projects, and get in ""early""

The only way this ends is with the early investors slowly but surely dumping their tokens that were acquired at a very cheap valuation on exchanges, while the price corrects 90-98%. 

Many times, terminology like ""vesting schedule"" or locked tokens is used just to confound the retail participants, to make them believe they wont get dumped on. There is a vesting schedule, so the early investors will baghold through a 90% correction right? Lol

There is not one single reason any long term investor must look at these projects. There are several distribution mechanisms in existence today that are much more fair, including stake drops, farm distributions etc where one can acquire tokens of new projects without donating their funds away to the team at a terrible valuation. 

Most of the VCs in the crypto space are pure predators. They give zero fucks if the project even survives or not, as long as they exit their investment with a ton of cheese on top. They can hardly be fussed about the late investors or users. This is the rather sombre reality of an unregulated market - the ones making the rules do it predominantly to enrich themselves.",0,"VCs are getting into projects at 22c, and then dumping it to the public at $27 in a ""public sale"".

vvb777,"I'm am not complaining about anyone getting profits from SHIB/meme coins or to discourage anyone from investing because my $ 20 SHIB turned in  $110. As it stands SHIB has a massive following right now and it's that hype that is playing a key role in the skyrocketing of its price.

Everyone wants to see their portfolio go to the moon and to most it doesn't matter how just once they get those profits. Most go for coins that you could acquire by the thousands or millions in a bid to secure their big pay day if it hits that  $1 mark or any amount to 1000x their investment. It has worked for many and has failed arguably more. From a crypto perspective many will view this as short term.

milonuttigrain,"A survey by Cardify finds that only 16.9% of investors who have bought crypto ""fully understand"" the value and potential of cryptocurrency, while 33.5% of buyers have either zero knowledge about the space or would call their level of understanding ""emerging.""

sonaldas110,"I have some millions of SHIB in my bags. I made profit? No, not a significant ammount as I FOMOed and bought at previous ATH. So why am I making this post?

The reason is to share my perspective about this meme coin. First of all for the newbies who are having fomo, these are way too much volatile and risky, yes crypto is itself risky but it conveys the highest bar of that risk factor (for god sake don't ruin your health all time looking at the charts). I don't like this coin personally (ready for the downvotes) as I don't see any solid motive or practical use case rather than just hold and making quick bucks. These coins are literally being driven by the community power. The astronomical imagination of the coin going to the $1 mark. I mean seriously? 

Then shouldn't you buy or stay away from meme coins? I will say no, you obviously can make some small gains and this is not a financial advice but the best thing I love about these memecoins that it brings people to the cryptoworld as most of the times people are afraid/lazy to do research and invest, which is not good for the adoption. Who doesn't love memes and who don't want to ride the hype train? The doge hype literally brought a lot of people previously. 

At the end we really don't know shit about fuck, there are no more wonders that wonder me anymore. But beware from the obvious rug pulls and sometimes ride that hype train, again NOT A FINANCIAL ADVICE AT ALL.",0,"Yeah, I hodl SHIB"

UnlistedSpecimen,"There's an Italian movie called ""Escoriandoli"" starring a wonderful (but sadly underrated actor) called Antonio Rezza.

In this movie, one of the characters intepreted by Rezza is a punk from the early 90s trying to find a way to capitalize on his small salary. In his main scene, he's seen walking in the street talking with himself and counting some money.

The monologue goes something like this:

""10 thousand, 20 thousand, 30 thousand... when I'll reach 2 millions, I'll buy 2 million cans of canned meat and I'll sell them to famiched populations for 6 millions. With those 6 millions I buy 6 millions lighters and then I resell them door-to-door with a gross gain of the 38%. With the net 38% I buy the gross 70% of the stock exchange and I resell it to the gross populations of North-Africa with a maximum rate of 22% and a minimum limit of 2%, with that percentage unbundled from the figure determining its value I buy the Strait of Gibraltar"".

I have a week of vacation ahead of me. What I planning on doing anyway, was trying to get a better umderstanding of finances in general, and markets and some TA in particular. 

The part about finances in general will be covered by books, I have found some online. If someone has  a recommondation for a great book about how the financial world works, I am open for suggestions. 

The TA thing is a difficult one and I am aware, that the markets behave according to a pattern until they don´t. But this is still something that fascinates me and while it might turn out to be that it is actually nothing more than guesswork (I think to determine that,  one has to try it for oneself), I am still positive, that I will learn something from this nonetheless.

crua9,"Long story short, this was the first year I was able to use bots. I wanted to see how well they would do vs natural trading.

What I found is it does make money, but unless if you have a ton to start with then it honestly isn't worth it. With tax tracking software, trading fees, and fees for the bot. It basically isn't worth it unless if you can make a ton of money with about a 5% ROI per month. (basically its a good tool for the rich. Not so much the poor)

Now here is where it gets nasty. If you're poor like me, then you can't afford a $40k CPA. This means you're stuck using some tracking software and that is it. The problem comes in with them being universal with LIFO or FIFO. From my under you can switch from LIFO to FIFO to LIFO sell to sell. But since the tracking software is universal this means you now have to pick one or the other. And sadly you have to stick with it or sell everything at the end of each year.

Selling everything automatically resets the long term timer (which you need to hold something for 12 months or longer to get into that anyways).

(FIFO is first in first out. It basically says what you're selling is reflected of your oldest stuff. So if you bought 100 something in 1990 and 100 now. Then sold 150 something tomorrow it will say 100 of that is from 1990 and the rest now. Which means 100 of that is long term tax bracket and the rest is short term. It basically is the reverse for LIFO last in first out.)

Anyways where the problem comes in is when you buy a given coin to hold. You later set a bot on the coin. With FIFO you could be seen as taking massive losses and gains. Since you can only deduct $3k in loss a year this means you will have to pay massive taxes gains you don't actually have due to how the bot and FIFO mesh. Running it through LIFO fixes this.

So where the big problem comes in is if you stake, mine, etc and you decide to sell. It would be mark under short term gains. This in the USA is automatically a higher tax amount and with the USA if you made less than $40k a year in long-term then there is no federal tax. So this means while you're paying less in taxes now. You also pay more later for normal stuff.

So why quit using the bot at all? Here is where the big kicker is. Tracking software tends to cost more per transaction. Meaning you will have to spend at least w cents per sell on tracking software if you use Koinly, you have to pay the trading fees, you have to pay taxes, and so on. And when you're gaining about 10 cents to 20 cents per trade. You're cutting it extremely close. And the profits between that and just normal trading. Normal trading always pays a lot more.

IMO bot trading isn't worth it unless if you're trading with something like $100k or even $1m to put into the bot. Like even if you don't make any mistake in oh you use a bot on a coin you already bought at a higher value (which still you will run into this problem with the nature of things). You realistically need to make $40k a year just to pay a CPA because if you ever get audited. It will be a nightmare for someone in poverty to get audited over 10k transactions or more.

TLDR bots are a rich person toy.

Note I'm not a financial or tax advisor. This is just from my experience",0,Something to note for those poor and wanting to get into using bots in the USA
plk8888,"I have been trying out some Defi incentivised-for-180-days LPs which have 130-150% APR (not APY, APR ...) and have been consistently getting the daily return expected over the last few weeks. This would indeed mean, all other things being equal, that the return would indeed be 600% APY with the compounding I do daily with the returns. This just seems to good to be true. It overrides most IL scenarios and, since it's more predictable that just buying the same coins and holding them seems to be ideal. It just can't be this good, clearly. Apart from IL, the risks seem to be:

*  It's mostly inflationary tokens like Atom/OSMO and so there is a chance over 180 days that inflation just reduces the coin value so when I liquidate, there are more coins that are worth less.
* The APR drops as more people pile into the incentivised pools and this brings things down to staking APR levels quite quickly.

jorgehn12,"I’ve been in crypto since may of this year. I went all in without knowing what the hell I was doing, and kinda regret it and kinda not.

I kinda regret it because I went all in in all kind of coins with only knowing it’s recent ATH. I had no direction of which ones to buy. Some of these include, I don’t have anymore, Filecoin, ICP, ETC, Doge, and others. 

I kinda don’t regret it because I’m here today and have made some small wins along the way and learned so much about TA. I got me some ETH at a low price which now makes me happy to see it trying to reach its ATH again. 

This brings me to my current crypto state. Since I missed out in so many good coins such as Solana, I saw it at $28 and didn’t buy it because I didn’t know poop, AXS, I saw it dirt cheap but because I don’t play video games I didn’t buy it, and of course the most loved/hated coin, SHIB, that I first bought like 3 months ago but sold days later because of the 0.1 cent thing, as well as many other just because I didn’t know how buy outside Coinbase. 

Now that I can look a coin, look at its EMAs and its MACD, I can have a better idea as to what it could do. As well as its purpose. 

I even wrote a program that queries coin gecko daily and it tells me if I need to sell or hodl. And it sends me an email with a chart of the past 90 days.

PasserottoDolcissimo,"Hello everyone,

I’m new here and I have a question about some market data I wish I could find somewhere.

**-Short question-**

The data I’m looking for is the price at which every individual share of a stock or unit of a crypto was traded last time.

Also an aggregated indicator that calculates the “sum of (each share \* last individual traded price)” would be ok. 

**-Detailed question-**

I would need this indicator to evaluate discrepancies in value of a stock or crypto. Indeed market cap, float and volume can be misleading indicators according to which shares they refers.

Practical example:

Let’s say a crypto (any shitcoin) is generated from nothing and have a total of 100.000 units, now each unit is priced 1$ so the market cap is 100.000$. In detail 50% of them was never traded (0$ tot), 30% was traded long time ago last time at 0.50$ (15.000$ tot) and the rest 20% is actively traded nowadays at 1$ (20.000$ tot). Therefore the real “acquired value over time” (AVOT) it is 0$+15.000$+20.000$=35.000$, and on average all the money put into this asset can support an average price of each unit of 0,35$ (against 1$ of the current price). 

The way AVOT changes is disconnected from any other classic indicator (market cap, volume, float, SMA, EMA, etc) because changes according to which individual units are moved.

Continuing the example let’s say that today 20% of the units are traded at market price (1$). This won’t change the market cap, float or average volume compared to the previous example. In case this 20% are the units bought at 1$ the AVOT won’t change and remain 35.000$. If instead the traded ones are from the pool of the 50% untouched units then it will become +20.000$+55.000$, and on average all the money put into this asset could support an average price of each unit of 0,55$ that is way closer to the actual price and therefore more reliable and solid.

Second scenario: let’s say that 40% of the units are traded during a selloff at market price of 0.5$. In case the units sold are half the ones bought at 1$ and half the ones bought at 0$ the market cap will become 50.000$ and the AVOT 30.000\*0$+20.000\*0,5$+30.000\*0.5$+20.000\*0.5$=35.000$. In the case instead the units sold are entirely the ones bought at 0$ the AVOT will be 10.000\*0$+40.000\*0,5$+30.000\*0.5$+20.000\*1$=55.000$, that’s even higher than the market cap that stays at 55.000$. 

Overall having the AVOT price would give me an idea on the fragility of the stock/crypto, telling me if the price I’m paying is close or far from the amount of money that globally and all time long people put in that asset.",0,"Where to find the ""acquired value over time"" of a stock/crypto (if it exists)?"

I can see in the future games like GTA with NFT cars and weapons and even clothes. That would revolutionize gaming. Maybe an RPG games with player based economies with different professions and loot that is all NFT. I think the future is bright but we’re no where near the point where is worth getting into.

awezumsaws,"I'm not a financial advisor, and I only got into crypto in early May, but I am by nature a very driven-by-data person, so I've spent the last few months researching technical analysis of Bitcoin and meta analysis of the psychology of markets. What I will explain below is, I think, a fair, data-driven speculation, and I will acknowledge caveats at the end.

According to Elliot wave theory, we are in the 5th wave of a growth trend which historically has ended with Bitcoin having an increasing valuation from the 4th wave bottom at increasingly lower percentages of growth. This is easily seen in the ""[rainbow chart](https://www.blockchaincenter.net/bitcoin-rainbow-chart/)"" of Bitcoin's lifecycle. Here are the numbers (in USD, approximated for easier calculations):

* In the 4th wave bottom of 07/2013, Bitcoin fell to 69.70, then in 12/2013 rose to 1237.60 (1,775% of the 4th) before falling in 01/2015 to 166.50 (240% of the 4th) which was a 86.5% fall from the 5th wave peak
* In the 4th wave bottom of 07/2017, Bitcoin fell to 1826.20, then in 12/2017 rose to 19,891 (1,090% of the 4th, 61.5% of the growth of the same time period from the previous cycle) before falling in 12/2018 to 3215.20 (175% of the 4th) which was a 84% fall from the 5th wave peak

Extrapolating those numbers and the Elliot wave theory out to today, where 07/2021 was a 4th wave bottom when Bitcoin fell to 29,313, we should expect approximately 570% growth (60% of the growth of the same time period from the previous cycle) at the 5th wave peak which would have Bitcoin around 195,000 in 12/2021 before falling in 12/2022 to 46,900 which would be a 75% fall from the 5th wave peak.

Given that there is exponentially more institutional investment in this market cycle than in previous cycles, I have strong doubts that the next peak in the Elliot wave will be only 570% of the 4th wave bottom and that the next fall will be 75%, so here are some speculative correction percentages:

* At 500% of the 4th wave bottom and 70% correction, Bitcoin would rise to 205,000 and fall to 55,500 (190% of the 4th)
* At 500% growth and 60% correction, Bitcoin would fall to 74,000 (250% of the 4th)
* At 570% growth and 70% correction, Bitcoin would fall to 55,500 (190% of the 4th)
* At 570% growth and 60% correction, Bitcoin would fall to 74,000 (250% of the 4th)
* At 600% growth and 80% correction, Bitcoin would rise to 205,000 and fall to 41,000 (140% of the 4th)
* At 600% growth and 70% correction, Bitcoin would rise to 205,000 and fall to **61,500** (210% of the 4th) - we were at that number this week
* At 600% growth and 60% correction, Bitcoin would rise to 205,000 and fall to 82,000 (280% of the 4th)

As you can see from this wide array of calculations, the inevitable major correction cycle will bring us back down to a level that we have already recently seen or are likely yet to see in Q4 2021. I share this because it is helpful for me to mentally prepare now for the psychological blow of seeing numbers like ""195,000"" slowly turn into numbers like ""60,000"". I was certainly psychologically unprepared to see 64,000 turn into 29,313 or see my ""buying the dip"" of ETH at 3,990 turn into 1,721 which old-timers in this market will surely tell you was nothing they hadn't lived through before. May we all keep our heads about us through the remainder of this cycle and beyond.

Caveats:

* One major caveat to this speculation is the possibility that COVID-19 in 2020 introduced a false downward trend into the Elliot wave which would mean we are not actually in the 5th wave of the pattern but the 3rd. In this case, my extrapolations are meaningless as it is impossible to forecast what impact an economic crisis from a global pandemic has done to the market cycle.
* Due to the lengthening cycles of this market (see the rainbow chart) and market capitalization, it is also unlikely to see the rapid growth in a mere 2.5 months as I indicated. However, the Elliot cycle runs independently of the calendar, so the 5th wave could easily run well into 2022, and the correction/fall run well into 2023, but the numbers themselves would still play out. I happen to believe this is actually what will happen, again given the institutional investment and market capitalization in this cycle.
* And of course I, like everyone, don't know shit about fuck, so take all this with a few grains of salt

Final speculation: I also believe that when we see the correction at the end of this cycle, it will occur largely in parallel to a major correction in the US stock market. There will be a period of time (late 2022 to early 2023) when the decreasing value of the US dollar due to inflation will be less than the decreasing value of both stocks and cryptocurrencies, so there will be a pullout from both markets. When the dust settles, the crypto market will be globally recognized as the safer investment, and by 2025-26 we will see stability enter the crypto market that has not yet been seen, eventually leading to a flattening of the rainbow chart and the end of the US dollar as the global standard in the early 2030's. Then, the ""crypto market"" will cease being just that, and the different market sectors - tech, pharma, real estate, insurance, etc - will become sectors within the crypto market itself as those industries migrate operations to blockchain and adopt cryptocurrency payment systems. All this final shifting will rise out of the next correction cycle of the current Elliot wave which is years away, perhaps more than a decade away. If you entered this market when I did and got smacked in the face almost immediately but hung in there, it's ok. We really are still early.",0,"Be happy where we are in the market today, because we may be here again"
Fluid_Department_120,"#During the last month, four out of five of the top stablecoins by market capitalization saw their valuations swell in size. At the time of writing, there’s $135.4 billion in stablecoins but the top five collectively represent 94.40% of that total. While the largest stablecoin in terms of market cap increased by 2% over the last 30 days, the stablecoin DAI issued by the Makerdao protocol expanded by 22%.



Tether and Circle’s USD Coin Rule the Roost
Stablecoins are very popular these days and it’s safe to say that these dollar-pegged tokens are not going anywhere any time soon. For instance, at the time of writing, there’s around $29.2 billion in global trade volume dedicated to bitcoin (BTC) trades only.

Currently, the stablecoin tether (USDT) commands 61.46% of all the BTC trades according to cryptocompare.com data. Below the U.S. dollar is the stablecoin BUSD, a stablecoin curated on the Binance Smart Chain as BUSD commands 5.29% of all BTC trades today.

BUSD is, in fact, the only stablecoin in the top five that did not see its market cap inflate. The largest stablecoin market cap today is tether (USDT) which commands a valuation of $71 billion at the time of writing, according to market aggregation sites like Coingecko’s “Top Stablecoins by Market Cap.”

Tether’s transparency web page that shows Tether’s current balances says there’s approximately $70,578,488,377 worth of USDT. With close to a $71 billion increase, USDT has grown by 2% during the trailing 30 days.

The second-largest stablecoin issued by Circle and the Centre Consortium, usd coin (USDC), has swelled by 8.9% this month. Presently, USDC has a market valuation of around $32.8 billion which is around 46.19% or close to half the size of USDT’s market cap.

Tether’s global trade volume is much higher than USDC’s at $52,791,455,644 while USDC’s is around $1,936,810,797. USDC is paired with USDT and BUSD and according to cryptocompare.com data, they are the top two trading pairs with USDC.

#The 3rd, 4th, 5th Stablecoin Contenders
While the stablecoin that stems from the Binance Smart Chain (BSC) ecosystem, busd (BUSD) is the third-largest cap, it has not increased during the last month. BUSD holds a valuation of about $12.9 billion at the time of writing and $3.4 billion in global trade volume. BUSD is swapped on 98 different exchanges according to today’s data and it’s ranked 18th out of 9,957 crypto assets.

The algorithmic decentralized finance (defi) stablecoin issued by the Makerdao project, dai (DAI), has seen the most growth this past month gaining 22.7%.

dbc13543,"I see a lot of people on here mischaracterizing what ""taking profits"" means and then attacking their straw-man definition.

Taking profits does NOT mean selling everything and walking away.  At least, in most situations.  Taking profits means selling a *portion* of your portfolio when the market is irrationally high -- for example when the Fear &amp; Greed Index is spiking.

If you choose to then make a quality-of-life choice to spend those profits on a vacation then so be it.  But often people leave out the most common scenario which is to *use those profits to buy back in when prices are irrationally low again.*  

There's nothing clever about HODLing Bitcoin back in April at $64k and watching with a dumb look on your face as it retraces back to $30k in July and you have nothing to show for it.

Smart money saw the writing on the wall at $64k, sold a *portion* of their portfolio while prices were high, then accumulated again in the $30k range.  Now their portfolio is back at $60k Bitcoin but *they have more of it*.

**Tell me have you seen the glorious Hamster?**

Having witnessed this sub's commentary on the legendary crypto-trading hamster that generated significant gains, I sought out to get my own hamster. As I don't have enough time to invest in a pet, and because I wanted to practice my currently-shit coding skills, I opted to create my greatest invention yet: Hamster++, the robo-hamster that gives you financial advice (this is not financial advice) on what crypto to buy based on the highest quality random number generators.

&amp;#x200B;

**Random Number Generation**

In modern computer software, randomness is not truly random. To account for this inherently nonrandomness  within our random number generators, we call them pseudo (like, but not exactly) random number generators, or [PRNG](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pseudorandom_number_generator)s. The big thing with these good-enough random number generators is that if you know the starting value for the algorithm (the seed), you can effectively predict the generated sequence -- this is unacceptably nonrandom for my purposes.

Luckily, smart people with good reasons to be interested in PRNGs came up with a solution for this. They needed good random number generators to develop algorithms for important things like encryption, so they created advanced PRNGs that they properly named *cryptographically secure PRNGs, or CSPRNGs*.

The Python programing language enables you to make use of these advanced algorithms in its ""secrets"" module, intended for important things like password generation n shit. My dumbass used to to enable the most random selection of a crypto from a list (currently contains Coinbase Pro's listings).

&amp;#x200B;

**The Code**

If you're interested in the robo-hamster, you can get the code and resources off my github page here: [https://github.com/Adri6336/hampp](https://github.com/Adri6336/hampp) . Since this is my actual github, Imma use this here throwaway account. All scam messages sent to me will be ignored, mostly because I'm broke af and don't actually have any crypto to get stolen.

In order to run Hamster++, you'll need to have the latest version of [Python](https://www.python.org/) installed. Also, I made this on Linux, so the gui may look a lil wonky for Windows users -- I haven't had the opportunity to test it on Windows 10 yet",0,"Since we can't all afford a high quality hamster, I decided to make one"
Upsilon_psi,"Let's be honest for a second, the current crypto market is a shit show. It is basically a big ass Casino coupled with social media popularity contest. Having more people buy crypto and NFTs is not necessarily crypto/blockchain adoption. 

The way I see it, adoption means using the technology in our day to day life to provide a service and add value. It is not about buying low and selling high (or the most used strategy: buying high and selling low).

What's happening right now is playing a monopoly game on a Global scale. Think about it this way:

* If tomorrow, crypto just suddenly disappears, will that affect you life or the economy is any way? (other than the suicide hotline going crazy)
* How many are actually using crypto for paying for goods and services in such a way that FIAT money can't provide?
* How many are actually using NFTs for real life uses such identification, supply chain or protecting real work assets?

In other words, it is just transferring money from normal people to whales (and few early adopters). 

Some people might argue that this helps people learn, but unfortunately the contrary is happening. Most don't want to learn, they just want to buy a shitcoin with gazillion zeroes and ride it to the moon. That's why you can see a copy paste code with no use case what's ever having more 10x of proper innovative project with a development team and actual vision.

From what it seems, the majority are joining the hype and teaching other ignorant people wrong information, and for that it is a norm now that (these are just to list a few):

* Reflections = staking
* Decentralization doesn't mean shit
* Market cap doesn't mean squat
* a copy paste code/wallet/program is innovative if you say it loud enough 
* all coins are the same
* The worst of all, a scam project with so many red flags is being nominated for at least 4 award categories in a blockchain conference (I am not gonna name, if you know, you know) just because it has a cult. Which means, even the people who organize a blockchain summit can't even analyze transactions on a blockchain.

I believe in what crypto can bring, I hold it and will continue holding and I am actually in it for the tech (and the gain obviously). But I would prefer a sustainable slower gain that will continue, than a pump and dump scheme (which will be the case if the majority are into it just to make profit and scam the next guy).

24KSPECTRUM,"**Hello everyone. I wanted to share with you some tips I have picked up on my NFT journey!**

**When starting an NFT project it is super important to develop a strategy and a future vision. If there is a weak strategy or future vision, you can forget the rest. Your community loves when you have a plan and a story to tell. To develop a proper vision, you can ask yourself these three questions.**

1. **WHY -** WHY are you doing what you're doing? Are you doing it for the art? are you doing it for the community? Both? What's your story? Why did you get into this in the first place? These questions are fundamental when developing a marketing strategy and it gives people something to hold on to when first joining your community. People love stories, and if you can tell them a good story from the beginning, they are much more likely to hold on to your project! Tell them a bit about yourself, how old you are, your background, and why you're doing this in the first place.
2. **WHAT** \- This is where you demonstrate WHAT you're doing, how you are creating value for your community. Here, you will explain your vision and future plans and where you are going with the project. Here you could also explain how your art process works and what makes it valuable for the investors. In this part, you will give people a reason to stay in your community and make them curious about your project and believe in your future value and what you are doing.
3. **HOW** \- How are you going to do all this? Here is where the marketing kicks in. Every great project needs a great community, and it doesn't have to be thousands of people. You only need a handful of hardcore fans who believe in your work and want to be involved. Hold on to these fans. Give them something that not everyone gets fx. Airdrops and exclusive giveaways, be creative! Create an exclusive whitelist where they get exclusive drops in the future and early access to all your mints. Interact with them and make them a part of your project and even ask them for help and where they want to see your project in the future. If you build a good foundation, your marketing will be so much easier since your fans will spread the word. Although you have built up a good community, you still need to do some external marketing yourself. Below are some ways you can use marketing to gain new investors and followers.

**MARKETING**

1. Do it yourself or hire someone from your community or online to interact in different NFT communities and tell people more about your project. There are a bunch of varying Telegram and Discor(d) communities where people are looking for new projects to get into. This is where you combine the WHY - WHAT - HOW model into a short pitch, and if it's good enough, it will most likely convert into new active followers. Launching a project can be overwhelming, so don't try to take over the world on your first day. Ask for help.
2. Be active on Twitter, post sneak peeks, interact with your Twitter audiences as well as your Discor(d) community. Talk with them, ask them how they are doing, be honest, and never lie about anything or give false hopes. This is a crucial step to build up trust and be relevant. One false promise can take your project down, so be careful! 
3. Collabs, this is probably one of the best ways to market your selves in our opinion. Find projects similar to yours and ask for a collab. This is super effective BECAUSE if they already love the other project, they'll likely love yours. In our experience, this has gained us the most amount active followers. 
4. ADs this can be effective, but also, you could potentially spend LOADS of money with almost no conversion. Beware of this option since finding the right group to target can be a struggle.

This is a long-term game! Most projects don't gain hype overnight, so keep going and don't lose hope. If you believe in your art and have some people in your community who do as well, you probably have something special in your hands. Remember, projects don't need to sell out on the first day to be successful, and there will be some people on the way that will try to drag you down.

**Mistakes that we made and you should look out for!**

Be careful and judgmental when hiring an NFT promoter, both on Twitter and Discor(d). Especially beware of those who advertise them selfs as an NFT promoter. It may look like a good deal at first, with loads of retweets and likes, BUT most of these promoters charge a HIGH fee, and often you'll receive very few new followers, maybe 2 of them are active, and perhaps one of them slips into Discor(d). Ask them questions and be super judgmental. Otherwise, your budget will quickly burn up. If a promoter contacts you on Twitter claiming to be someone. Always ask them to contact you on Twitter through the account they're claiming to be representing.

ejMileman,"Grayscale funds are only way I have found to buy crypto in my IRAs at traditional brokers like Fidelity, etrade, etc.  I hold some GLDC - see below.

You can buy and sell GLDC all you want as long as you select ""speculative"" or ""aggressive"" on the investment style at Fidelity or Ameritrade.  Tada. You own crypto in an IRA without doing anything hard or complicated.  Just buy GLDC.

Some valuation info that doesnt' tie out? some FASB rule that requires them to state assets ABOVE NAV?

A lot of you might noticed that you can earn an interest if you stake or lend your money.

You might ask how long would it take to double the amount of your coins since that's something we all want, am I right?

Let me introduce the Rule of 72 to you then. According to that rule, to get an approximate time it'll take to double your investment is to divide 72 by the annual interest rate.

Now some examples to see it more clearly:

If your interest rate is 5 percents, it will take 15 years to double your coins.

With 8 percents, it would take app. 9 years.

Do you want to be faster and double your coins in 5 years? The rate should be then 14.4 percents.

Should you use compound interest on your coins? Definitely! Should you expect to double your $100, $1000 or $10000 in few months just from compound? Definitely not.",0,Compound interest or how to earn money

**1. How can I buy crypto?**

You can buy crypto from exchanges, or through P2P websites.

I recommend buying them from an exchange.

**2. Which Exchange should I use?**

Any exchange that is well known is safe.

The most common ones are Coinbase and Binance, while others use Kraken and Gemini as well. But remember to use Coinbase Pro to minimize fees!

There are pros and cons to all exchanges, but you can’t go wrong with any of these.

nikil1253,"It seems like over the past few months the number of scam coins and tokens has rocketed (to the moon), and I see so many people fall for them over and over again. Please, please, do some critical thinking before buying.

1. Does it have any of the words: moon, mars, or bull in it? If so, it's most likely a scam.

2. Do they promise you 2x and up returns? If so, it's most likely a scam.

3. Did you learn about it on Reddit? Is there no other public information available about it on sites such as CoinGecko or CoinDesk? If so, it's most likely a scam.

4. Does their website not have links to a GitHub or other public repository for you to review their code? If so, it's most likely a scam.

5. Is their website informationally sparse and lack actual substance? If so, it's most likely a scam. 

6. Do they require you to lock your coins/tokens without being able to sell them? If so, it's most likely a scam. One caveat to this is that there are reputable and long term projects that do require staking. If a new project requires you to lock your assets, then chances are the creator will end up selling after you pumped up the price.

7. Is there not a clear fundamental use, service, or some sort of problem that they are trying to solve other than to ""moon shot""? If so, it's most likely a scam.

The more items that the questionable coin/token hits on the list above, the greater the chance its a scam. Keep in mind that there are some legitimate projects that might hit one of these items, so use this as a guide and a moment to take a breath and think before you spend.

A lot of you probably know that CMC emails got leaked, but no passwords etc. Even if that is true, your email is enough to cause trouble!

Email phishing:
You will 99% receive spam emails that will try to phish your information for exchanges or banking. Don't fall for this. Do not open any email that you didn't use to get before the leak. Do not open any link that might say something about your wallet or your exchange. Always double and triple check the email addresses that send you the email and even then make sure the content of the email is safe.

Social Media:
If you used the same email for social media accounts, they might try to get into them. You should change your passwords and if it bothers you even more, make a new email for your social media.

Exchanges:
If your email got leaked and it is associated with any exchange, change your passwords and even change the email too. Enable 2FA, preferably with an Authenticator.

TLDR: If you don't feel safe with the leaked email anymore, make a new one and replace your old one from any platform you want. I suggest changing it everywhere.",0,CMC Email leak - How to protect yourself

JustAd2122,"Hi guys,

Couple of days ago I have been offered to buy into a shitcoin (which I won't name since it is not the point) and I have been wondering since how does it really work (creation and swap), how is the price being decided, how can one manipulate the price and why it is commonly said that you will not be able to sell the coin to get your money out.

Since I don't plan on making such a scam I don't want/need to go too deep in the subject and get all the technicity so if someone can explain/participate/give his/hers opinion I'm very thankful !

1. How does it really work?
To buy into said shitcoin you simply have to copy the contract address displayed on CMC or Coingecko and add it to a swapping plateforme. However, if you search for the coin in itself on a swapping plateforme you can't find any pool for it. So how can you swap it? Are the tokens locked into the smart contract and when you send some Eth to this address you get said amount of SHTC (for shitcoin)? Or is the smart contract actually a pool in which the creator of the coin has added both ETH and SHTC after creating the shitcoin ? If it is the first answer, then how the price evolves ? For price manipulation, I guess the creator just have to buy more of the coin when he wants it to go up. But in that case, isn't it possible to follow the transactions on the explorer and see if they all come from the same wallet/a wallet that has interacted with the same addresses over time, linking it to the owner ...?

2. How will you lose money?
If the coin gains in value because your friend has been very good at pitching it, you want to sell out and get your Eth out of it, some say there can be scenarios that there wouldn't be enough liquidity for that. But if the pool (/smart contract?) has been used for buying it, the price should be the direct image of the imbalance of tokens in the pool, hence you should be able to get tokens out on the other side by selling. Okay, your selling power will probably balance the price back to a neutral (or below original price) at some point but since you are not the only one who swapped, you should be on the safe side if, let's say, the coin went 10x, 100x or 1000x. No ?

I'm asking this second question because the price went 5-10x quite fast and I was wondering if investing a small amount of money just to double it wouldn't be a very easy and safe way of making money if you stay realistic. Like putting 1k and getting 2k out in two days, that's a pretty good job 🤷🏽‍♂️

So yeah, pretty long post for not so much, let's hope it interest also other people and someone care to share some knowledge here!

Thank you very much.",0,Shitcoin smart contract crash course

As of Saturday over 290,000 people have signed a change.org petition asking Robinhood to list Shiba Inu. Supporters of SHIB are hoping to push the price as high as $0.01 in the long term.

“Memes have value and have been an investible thesis in 2021,” Jonathan Cheesman, head of over-the-counter and institutional sales at crypto-derivatives exchange FTX, said in an email Sunday. “Lower dollar-price tokens are attractive to retail” because investors can still buy more than 20,000 SHIB for $1, he said.

NightCloud-,"Hi,
I'm looking for advice. I've been in crypto for a couple of months. I started in March of this year thanks to a friend. Following his advice I bought some coins from top 20 by market cap, mainly Ada and Vechain. In May I was very scared to buy some more because of the crash, but thanks to you guys I did and I've been rewarded. I bought Eth at ~2k (my best investment so far, really proud of that one) and I also DCA'ed my other coins. As time passed and I saw my portfolio grow, I started to watch a lot of crypto related content on Youtube. I love 2 channels in particular: IntoTheCrytoverse and Coinbureau, and I watch them daily.

Now that we are in a bull run and everyone is excited about the new ATH's of BTC and their favorite altcoins, I want to invest big. I am looking for a coin or maybe a couple, that will do well in the next couple of months (end of the year or even further into Q1 or Q2 of next year). My choise stopped with ethereum as it was my best investment so far and because I really do believe in the project and I don't see any other projects beating the smart contracts king anytime soon. I am now asking for your advice as you guys didn't disappoint me so far.


P.S: I understand the risks of my decision and if the market were to drop tomorrow and we would enter a bear phase I do believe that we would eventually grow back and make new ATH's, even if it takes a couple of years. I am confident that I wouldn't sell any of my coins at a loss because I don't need that money anytime soon and  I have a stable, well payed job.

In these incidents, the only common thing was the perpetrators have solid info about how much Crypto the victim is holding or gained? 

How did they knew? 

Probably they have overheard the victims conversation about his /her crypto holdings in a bar or a coffee shop,or at some other public place.
In some incidents,Victim was flaunting his profits from crypto in a public place and which proved very dangerous to their life.They suffered physical harm, mental trauma, financial loss just because of one mistake,i.e. talking, flaunting their Crypto investments carelessly in a public place.,which set the target on their back.

paulrudder,"Hey guys, a while back I used BNB on Pancake Swap to buy a poocoin called WIFEDOGE. I did it purely to experiment with how to use the app and didn't put much money in at all, but I still managed to turn $15 into like $4.

Last month I decided to convert it back to BNB, so I approved the transaction and then on the confirmation screen it indicated that after network fees I should have walked away with abkut $2.50 in BNB... but the final transaction amount under my history in Trust Wallet is $0. Not sure if it was a scam, if i did something wrong, or if there wasn't enough liquidity, but the $2.50 just vanished. I even pulled it up on BSCScan and it showed the $2.50 supposed value but then at the bottom said $0 as total value after the transaction processed. 

Even stranger is I noticed today while importing my data to Koinly that I still have some WIFEDOGE left in my trust wallet balance (even though I had told pancake swap to ""sell"" / swap the max amount possible when I did the transaction last month). 

So I was going to try to do another conversion to BNB to totally clear out the remaining balance of this shitcoin and get it off my portfolio, but it's showing $0.56 in network fees and a total earning of $0. I am so confused. Here are screen shots:

http://imgur.com/a/ohdFSDM

If my total value is $0, then where is the network fee being taken from? If I don't have any value for the transaction, where is it going to pull the $0.56 from? Because to me it looks like there is nothing to deduct it from? 

And my other question...Is there *any* way to get rid of the remaining WIFEDOGE or is this some kind of liquidity issue / do I just have to let it sit there in my account?

Very grateful and appreciative for any answers to the above questions, I feel like I'm missing something obvious here but none of it is making sense to me.

northwesternsamurai,"“The lawsuit filed Friday notes that the SEC contacted Kwon over Mirror Protocol back in May 2021, before Kwon was interviewed for five hours the following month. The filings note that the SEC attorneys then advised Terraform Labs that “enforcement action was warranted” on Sep. 15, 2021. Kwon was served with the subpoenas at Mainnet five days later. 

Kwon’s lawsuit contests the SEC’s request for him to provide testimony to U.S. regulators, arguing that he is a resident of South Korea. It also takes issue with the way the subpoenas were served: SEC rules state that investigations should be confidential, but the agency hired a group called the Cavalier Courier &amp; Process Service to serve him the subpoenas at the event. A note in the lawsuit reads: 

“Hiring a “Cavalier” process to approach Mr. Kwon in public, and announce the purpose of his approach, at a summit attended by more than 2,000 people was, at worst, an intentionally brazen display meant to publicly intimidate and embarrass, and at best reckless, creating social media and press speculation about the incident within minutes of the attempted service of process.”

The SEC serving a subpoena publicly in front of thousands of people clearly going against its own policies is so blatantly an act to intentionally bully, intimidate, and harass defi.

FutureIsCrypto,"As I was reading the front page this morning, there was a particular comment that really hit me. I don't remember who it was but they said something along the lines of ""***how we feel about SHIBA-INU's growth and how it is fundamentally, is the same way how non-crypto people view us***."" This hit me like a train in that it rings very true. Think of how many people you have talked to about cryptocurrency (if any) and have questioned its use-case, legitimacy, value, etc. Of course, some will agree and that's awesome. However the ones that don't agree will later go on to spread ill-will towards crypto because they have missed out and most likely are somewhat jealous. I will admit, I still struggle with this from time to time. 

For us, we viewed Doge and SHIB as meme coins who were supposed to be nothing more than a pump and dump or, just speculative fun. I think for most of us, we feel somewhat jealous that the hours we spent researching our coins were in vain as we see coins such as these rise significantly in value while our coins are down. In the back of our minds I think we all wanted to take a small chance on them but were too hesitant to invest based on what the majority of people were saying here. Instead of the ill-feelings towards the people who have made some nice gains, we should congratulate them on their success and having some **diamond balls** lol. 

Look back at when you first entered the cryptoverse. You took a speculative chance, gamble, risk, or however you want to word it against what the majority of people were telling you. Chances are, you have done pretty damn well up to this point. It's no different than what people who have invested in Doge or SHIB have done. They went ***against the majority*** and came out on the other end a whole lot richer. In the end, our profits from any coin are most likely going to flow back into the market as we chase more gains. Unless you want to buy that Lambo, then as r/Wallstreetbets would say... fuck you and good job.

If we want to hit that 10 trillion dollar market cap for crypto as a whole, we need to be unified and hype each other up when gains are made or help each other out when we bleed from the rear.

But then we have meme coins like doge and shiba elevating the poor to new heights...

Why is this....

Because poor people, like myself, feel as if the crypto train has left us behind... Unless you were lucky enough to get in before April 2020.

So the poor look for that gamble... They can't buy 1 btc, but $400 buys you 10,000,000 shiba inu.

10,000,000 x .01 is $100,000

100,000,000 shibe. X .001 is $100,000

But 100,000,000 x .01 is $1,000,000.....

This is how we are thinking.... Desperate to get out of poverty.. A prayer, and a dream.

I'm not endorsing shitcoins... But I am watching and a part of what is happening...

Then we start to see huge amounts of money being moved into these coins.... I'm talking $100's of millions of dollars...

The price spikes overnight..... 

Yesterday 10,000,000 shiba cost $280, today $410...

A few months ago you could get 100,000,000 shibes for this price....

The moderate conservative crypto invester at first... Laughs, then they mock, but after seeing 300-1000's% gain, they join in...

Market cap shoots up billions over night... 2 meme coins are in the top 15...

More money from the middle class and upper class join in...

Now memes are flying...

Poor people that put in a few hundred bucks are now worth $10,000- $100,000's... A few millionaires are made.

As the frenzy continues.... More zeros are dropped of the price... Now it takes more money to make less returns... But people are greedy.

Now a meme that way 10,000th of a penny are now 1000th of a penny.... More millionaires are created from a few $1000 investment.

It's happening before our eyes... We seen it with doge, from ..004 to .74 in less than a year.... Now shibe removed 2 zeros in a year.

Like it or not, but the great wealth transfer has begun... The rich and middle class are handing money over to the poor fist over fist...

The very rich are making 100-300% returns in bitcoin... While the poor are making 1000's-10,000's% on memes..

I'm not endorsing memes.... It's very risky... But I'm holding both doge n shiba... And am experiencing the shift directly...

I know there will come a time where they may disappear, maybe by the end of the 4yr cycle....

Even better its instant transactions during business days so don't worry about the 3-5 day crap.  Also the Proton team will respond super quickly if you have an issue and email them.  They are also very active in r/Protonchain.

This is just a small example,  but crytpos like this are going to survive the long run.  Functionality is getting stronger too as the big coins show their flaws.

# What is it?

EOS is a blockchain platform designed to develop decentralized applications (DApps). Its operation is similar to the Ethereum platform, with the exception that it is faster and more scalable. It enable developers to build decentralized applications more efficiently. EOS is a project strongly focused on solving many of the problems of blockchain technology, especially from those who keep it away from massification and global adoption. To achieve this, it has a number of fundamental pillars to satisfy, they are:

* **Free use:** the platform must offer flexibility to developers and users to offer free services. This indicates a more widespread adoption of the technology.
* **Recovery from errors:** the platform must be robust enough to correct errors when they inevitably occur.
* **Sequential performances:** there are some applications that simply cannot be implemented with parallel algorithms due to sequential dependent steps. For this reason, the platform must support fast sequential performance.
* **Parallel performance:** large-scale applications need to divide the workload across multiple CPUs and computers.

# How does it work?

In this aspect, EOS is similar to Ethereum. The capabilities of both to enable distributed application development are immense. However, there are important technical points where EOS has some advantage.  Among these points are:

* Ability to provide accounts, authentication systems and databases.
* Asynchronous communication between nodes.
* Parallel application programming to exploit the potential of multiple CPU cores and / or clusters.
* High scalability.
* Elimination of fees and commissions.
* Quick and easy deployment of decentralized applications.
* Simple upgrade system.
* Error recovery.

Another important point is that it has a consensus protocol designed for high scalability. In developing EOS, the team decided to implement the **Delegated Proof of Stake (DPoS).** In this way, all those who possess EOS tokens will be able to choose to produce blocks thanks to a voting and approval system. Money production is permissive. That is, a user can produce blocks in proportion to the votes he accumulates. The network can produce one block every 0.5 seconds and batches of 126 blocks every time.

# Where to store it?

The best hot wallet for EOS are Scatter, EOS-voter, SimplEOS and Exodus If you want more security, a cold storage like Ledger is the right choice

# Pros&amp;Cons

\*DISCLAIMER\* These lists are subjective, it depends from person to person

**Pros**

1. High scalability
2. Great roadmap and devs team
3. Low transaction fees

**Cons**

1. Transactions are not anonymous
2. Not completely decentralized",0,KnowYourCrypto #39: Eos (EOS)

lordofming-rises,"Hello!
I have been considering just buying the top 10 coins per marketcap and this every month like 500 dollars with 25 percent for BTC and ETH and the other 50 percent for the 8 other coins.

With that I am expecting to have some gains at least on some coins and avoid FOMOing everywhere and instead I would do a check every end of month and sell the ones that didn't perform well  and rebalance for again the 10 new marketcap (removing tether and maybe take another coin like ONE or FTM that has also promising uptrend).

Now I wonder on which plateform doing that, because I have Jade card for Crypto.com and I have one or two coins on Binance and Kraken.

For me crypto.com seems easier because I usually top up anyway every months for my groceries on it so adding a little bit more would avoid me transfering twice. But the spread is shit. Is that difficult to transfert to exchange en then use exchange? 

What are your thoughts?  And is it wise my strategy or is it just plain dumb and I should go all in Shib (which soon will be on marketcap 10 aha)

kirtash93,"Welcome to **Round 32 of the Cryptotrivial 2021 contest**!

# Question 32: A technical analysis indicator that measures market volatility. It's made of two sidelong bands and a simple moving average.  

The correct answer of **Round 31** is...

# Block Header!

**What is a Block Header:**

The block header is a section in a block that serves as a summary of the rest of the block. It’s made up of all the metadata – such as the time and difficulty when the block was mined, the Merkle root of the included transactions, and the nonce. Also present is the previous block’s hash, which is what allows us to create the “chain” of blocks. In essence, the block header contains any data that isn’t the list of raw transactions itself.

A block header is what the miners hash to try and make the block valid. This is a lot more efficient than hashing the entirety of the block, which can be made up of thousands of transactions. It would be vastly more cumbersome for a miner to change the nonce and to rehash a whole 2MB block for every attempt. Compare this with hashing Bitcoin’s block headers, for instance, which have a fixed length of 80 bytes. 

Block headers are great from a mining point of view, but because of their small size, they’re also ideal for light clients. The Bitcoin blockchain is too large for devices like smartphones to store. If the chain had 100,000 1MB blocks, you’d consume 100GB of space. But with just the block headers for those same blocks, you’d only take up 0.008GB, or 8MB.

In this way, devices with less bandwidth or storage space can still perform some degree of validation. Because the Merkle root encapsulates all of the transactions, they can later check whether a transaction was included in a particular block. This does come at a cost – the user must still rely on a third party to provide them with necessary information. With that said, light clients are preferable to a system where the users perform no verification at all.

I have tested the Solana nft space which seems to be 2nd biggest space other than ETH but there is a lot of overpriced projects imo.

Jasquirtin,"As shib is pumping we have many new people entering the space from their favorite YouTuber or person on Twitter telling them to buy shib. And it sure as hell is working to this point congrats. 

But the problem is many of you newbies don’t understand MC I just got flamed for pointing out to two people that shiba will not EVER hit a penny (.01). I was accused of it being just like BTC to 10k and doge to 50 cent. Okay no shib is like neither of those. 

Let’s revisit market cap shall we? The market cap is a metric we use to compare coins to one another it’s THE thing to check when you want to know potential price action of a coin. MC= circulating supply x current market price. BTC is the #1 coin at 1.1T (1 decimal place) MC. You can calculate that with $60,300 (current Market price) x 17 million (circulating supply). No one with a brain should believe your coin will surpass this. 

Let’s look at shib shall we. A current MC of 17 billion. It’s got some room to run sure. Will it get to a penny? No shot. Why? MC. To get to 1 cent shib will need to 238x from here. That would be a market cap of 17B x 238 = over 4T. All of crypto is currently 2.55T. It’s NOT HAPPENING THIS RUN. 

If you are new I hope this helps cause I doubt your influencer who told you to buy explained this. If you made money great but no your $50 will not 300x you will not hit $1 the supply continues to go up daily making it even harder. I hope this helps.",0,A reminder Shib will NOT hit 1 penny
BradlyL,"Like many, when I got into crypto many years ago, I was personally attracted to the idea of a decentralized network, which isn't owned by an elite few, or some middle-man.

Today, it seems the average newcomer has little to no interest in this principle. Moreover, I find it interesting that many who've even been interested/invested in cryptocurrency, continue to show minimal interest in some core principles of economics, such as: Market capitalization, 'Tokenomics', reading a whitepaper, trading/investment principals....and possibly most disturbingly **Distribution of Tokens (wealth)!** 

Imagine for a moment a small elite group of 100 people, in control of assets used by millions. Able to manipulate the market at will, and cash in on their centralized game at any time...Its a scary fate to imagine, especially if you're one of those players in their game.

The truth is that this isn't imaginary....it's quite literally what the current cyrpto market looks like...

Enter, **Shiba Inu....Where 82.14%** of all tokens are owned by just 100 people! 

Or even worse **Binance...Where 98.8% of USD coin** and **95.57% of Binance Coin** is owned by the Top 100 holders.

Jlin153,"Now, I usually don’t ever post on this sub but I just check on it every couple of days. 

With Shib hitting a new ATH, it seems that many people in this sub are upset that the coin itself didn’t go crashing down and losing everyone’s money. But this confuses me because majority of people looked down on the coin instead of just taking a bit of lottery money and tossing it in for the heck of it like how everyone else is.

First, I would disclose that I tossed 300$ in the project around March. And I seen that grow to immense sense amounts and also fall insanely just as quick. Yes, I held despite looking at all the posts saying “scam, rug pulls... etc.” but at the end of the day, it was just a experiment in crypto. The fundamentals are not as “professional” or solid as other coins, but the coin has still delivered on its projects that it promised the people. Instead, people still called it a shitcoin.

Why do people let their pride get in their way of making money? Many companies know the coin has so much hype around it that it be foolish for them to not list it. The amount that was made from doge itself by robinhood was insane and I have a feeling the same can be said around this coin.

Just be happy for those that invested because they risked their money. And their money is just as hard earned as your money.

Now if you feel like you missed out, wait for the coin to stabilize or drop, and just toss some spare into it so that next time when it pulls the unthinkable, at least you are in it for the ride too.

The crypto world is still new. There is plenty of room to hold “real” projects and still play with “shitcoin”. It is actually quite entertaining with the community.",0,What’s with all the Shib hate?

It doesn’t matter if they bought SHIB and made profit, you’re probably pissed because you missed out on those profits.

Most people who invest in Shitcoin, buy them because 

a) They don’t have knowledge about market cap etc. and are new to crypto.

- instead of hating them, we should try to educate them. But you should never tell anyone what to not / invest in. Only educate them.

b) They did it for fun.

- they understand that SHIB isn’t gonna make them a billionaire but they still think it can go up, or it might go down but they’re ready to gamble and take responsibility for it.

Megablastortoise,"Alright so I just woke up, did my morning routine of obsessive chart checking, and scrolled to my favorite subreddit and first thing I see is a post about Shib ATH and Doge having a nice run up making a poor fella feel like shit. 

WELL GUESS WHAT? YOU’RE NOT OWED ANYTHING. You clearly saw the Doge run earlier this year, and have witnessed first hand how a coin with no fundamentals can launch itself to life changing amounts of money. Many people actually were drawn to crypto from this. At the end of the Doge run, I’m sure we all had a small hint of thought “SHIB would do something similar.” And if I’m being blatantly honest, I had a gut feeling that it would 100% have some type of run. But I didn’t put anything in myself either. And I am not complaining. You know why? 

Because if you go to my hometown, R/wallstreetbets, one that I’m sure we are all familiar with, you will see that they work with STOCK OPTIONS, much of which can make fortunes or losses overnight and has been literally equated to GAMBLING. What is gambling build upon? You guessed it, HYPE. You and I both knew this had a tiny minuscule chance of launching but we decided to go the safe and long method of investing in “strong fundamental coins” that we likely don’t even know shit about. The market is ALWAYS BUILT ON HYPE. Even your “strong fundamentals coin” had hype at some point. 

So when I hear all this nonsense complaining about the “wrong coin going up” I want to remind everybody that none of us are entitled to anything, and that YOU AREN’T PLAYING THE SAME GAME AS SHIB AND DOGE HOLDERS, and if they make some money well then f’n be happy for them because you are also hoping one day you get there too right? 

This crab mentality needs to stop. If you want to invest safely, do it. If you want to gamble with shit coins, do it. If you want to fly to Vegas and bet all your life savings on black, do it.

Who said that when bitcoin and the family were at 30k the investment would run to 120% gain.

Jeronemoo,"# Introduction

You've seen VRA or Verasity mentioned here and there, perhaps you've heard about their plight to defeat online ad fraud. People are hyped, but you don't really know what Verasity does. In this post I'm going to give you a quick overview of the problem they aim to solve and their solution.  
Summary at the bottom for those that dislike large posts.

# Which industry is Verasity aiming for?

The problem they aim to solve has everything to do with the online ad tech industry. In a single sentence: 

&gt;Online ad tech industry, or online AdTech, refers to a network of interconnected technologies working to make sure the right people get the right ads at the right time. 

The online part is important, because the *online* AdTech industry is growing at an incredible rate. The online AdTech industry spending worldwide was calculated to be around [378 billion U.S. dollars in 2020, growing to an estimated 646 billion U.S. dollars by 2024](https://www.statista.com/statistics/237974/online-advertising-spending-worldwide/)!

So basically all the work that is done in order for you to see, and hopefully interact with, an ad, online. Ads on website, mobile phones, TVs, tablets, any digital device. All tools needed to design, build, serve &amp; maintain those ads.  
All of that, is the **online AdTech industry**.

[Seriously, there's a lot going on before you see an ad](https://preview.redd.it/9ke2y514iev71.jpg?width=1242&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f1782964ce6a7de1eeffd32d5ead42653c91eb79)

# Which problems does the online ad tech industry face?

Brands don't always know exactly where their ads end up, or who views them. Invalid traffic, [bots roaming around](https://www.anura.io/blog/what-is-a-bot-and-how-do-bots-impact-digital-ad-campaigns), is another issue. Basically, as a Brand, you have no clue what you're paying for, you lack insights, you don't know if you reached the target audience. A complete lack of transparency.

Lack of transparency and fraud go hand in hand. The fact is, that online AdTech is growing so fast that technology couldn't (or wouldn't) keep up with fraudsters. According to [Forrester](https://www.forrester.com/report/Poor-Quality-Ads-Cost-US-Marketers-74-Billion-In-2016/RES136115), as much as **64% of ad fraud** **happens in the video ads sector.** Here are [some more statistics](https://www.statista.com/outlook/dmo/digital-advertising/video-advertising/worldwide), to give you an idea of the issues brands face:

https://preview.redd.it/0bgbuxnljev71.jpg?width=1400&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=fe23dc229830ea3f93c5af146bef3047ebed9093

To quote a [speech](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NEUCOsphoI0) (worth it to watch) given by P&amp;G CBO Marc Pritchard in 2017;

&gt;We have a media supply chain that is murky at best, Fraudulent at worst.

 

All in all, the online AdTech industry has a whole bunch of issues, video ad fraud being the biggest one. That is the one Verasity aims to solve.

# How does Verasity aim to solve these?

We have established, above, that a lot of issues in the online AdTech industry stem from lack of transparency, we all know [blockchain](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/blockchain.asp) inherently has this transparency.

Verasity has developed an ad platform called VeraViews. This platform makes use of Verasity's patented Proof of View technology to solve the issues mentioned above.

**Proof of View**  
Proof of View (PoV) is a patented Verasity technology that uses artificial intelligence, over 200 touchpoints, and third-party detection vendor partners to determine whether an ad is actually viewed by a person or not, in real time. PoV analyzes the data gathered and determines if the ad view is valid or fake. A valid ad engagement (a person viewed the ad) is stored on the blockchain afterwards, where it can't be tampered with.

All of this is done with your privacy in mind; No personal linkable data is stored.

# The solution: VeraViews

VeraViews is Verasity's platform that uses PoV to solve the above mentioned issues in the online AdTech industry. It is a complete advertising system allowing brands to upload their ad campaigns directly to take advantage of publisher ad space on their sites.

That means VeraViews cuts out the middleman; Money spent on ads is split between those that create all the value.

That's not all, here's some more added value VeraViews brings to the table;

* VeraViews offers full transparency to all parties in the advertising value chain, privacy compliant.
* Thanks to PoV every ad view paid for is an actual ad viewed by a person, eliminating ad fraud altogether.
* Publisher can get paid right away, instead of waiting months on end.

Simply put, VeraViews is a platform that Brands can easily use to create their ad campaigns, publish them and control them, all the while granting them all the benefits mentioned above. If you're up for a more in-depth technical explanation, I'd suggest you read[ this blog](https://medium.com/verasity/veraviews-ad-tech-platform-roll-out-proof-of-view-4815ba5e71eb). 

# Summary

To summarise what we've iterated over;

* The online AdTech industry makes sure the right people get the right ad at the right time.
* An enormous amount of ad money is lost on ad fraud due to lack of transparency, especially in the video ads sector.
* Verasity has created a ""Proof of View"" technology that can verify if an ad is viewed by a person, or by a bot.
* Verasity has created an easy-to-use ad platform called ""VeraViews"" that uses the PoV technology to eliminate ad fraud, while improving transparency and payment terms.",0,A quick introduction to VRA

Walmart, the leading retailer in the United States, has partnered with coin-cashing machine company Coinstar and crypto-cash exchange CoinMe as it enters the cryptocurrency space. The retailer has installed 200 Crypto ATMs at its various locations across the United States.

According to a Bloomberg report, the installation of the Crypto ATMs at Walmart stores will allow its customers to buy crypto at its various locations across the United States. Walmart intends to install at over 8,000 locations in the United States over the coming months.
In an interview with Bloomberg, the Chief strategy officer and head of research at BitOoda, Sam Doctor, said although Crypto ATMs are already popular in the United States, Walmart wants to make them available to more people.
He said, “Walmart expands Crypto access to more people, though, and gives it further legitimacy among skeptics, should they roll it out beyond an initial pilot.” Data obtained from Coin ATM Radar showed that there are currently more than 25,000 Crypto ATMs at service stations and grocery stores across the United States. Coinstar currently operates more than 4,400 kiosks that support Crypto purchases in 33 states of the country.

shinjur,"The mental side of trading takes time to overcome. If you have a plan and stick with it, you will probably do well. Give it time. 

Following hype *can* sometimes work well but just as often leaves you holding the bag and regretting your buy. These things are hard to predict, especially when you’re new. 

But sometimes they aren’t hard. Some of the people who have made big money don’t understand very basic investing principles and got lucky. Sometimes even [hamsters](https://www.npr.org/2021/09/25/1040683057/crypto-trading-hamster-goxx-warren-buffet-s-p-500)  make above-average traders.

If you know someone who has made money but you have missed out, congratulate them, maybe even try to learn from the experience. But often there really isn’t much to learn other than their token(s) took off and yours didn’t/haven’t yet and your trading plan might still be just fine, it just wasn’t your day.

P13r15,"Most of us ""discovered"" crypto through a friend or the internet.. but it took us doing/seeing or experiencing something that made us stay and say yup, it's more risky to NOT have a part of our portfolio in crypto... What is YOUR story??
When did you hear about cryptocurrency, what was your first impression, what is your impression now and most importantly what event/coin changed your mind (if it changed that is).

I'll start:

A friend of mine was the one who introduced me into crypto back in 2013... Of course the coin he was into was Bitcoin.. I was immediately into it and was researching heavily.. my first actual investment though was in 2015.. and it was Litecoin... I purchased it at $3 and hold to it until 2017 , where I sold it for $54... I was a uni student at the time, and making an 18x on my investment was just.. unbelievable.. even as I was withdrawing the money I was still feeling like I was doing something illegal/wrong... Fast forward and i got to cry when it flewww to over $350 (and his big brother BTC over 19k).. and then feel like I dodged a bullet when it fell under $25.. After that , with uni life, and me losing interest, I didn't get into crypto again till October of 2020.. my next coins were dogecoin , which I honestly got just for the memes (bought over 13000 of them for $100 and another 100.000 of them for $2000).. and sold them for $14000... I've been holding MATIC ever since.. Polygon and it's network are just.. so appealing to me.. and i don't really see it going under the price I bought it for ($0.098).. So yeah, it will remain on staking, until I am satisfied with the amount and sell some of it.
No idea what my next coin will be, and how the crypto space will look until then, all I know for sure is I never see a time where I will ever NOT hold ANY crypto ever again. 

Tldr: just read the title and the first paragraph, the rest is just my story, and is not necessary to read if you don't want ;)",0,What made you realise that crypto-investing is the way??

Risk Free Methods

1.Mining

Just a great way for passive income, made like $100, I use kryptex for mining eth and vertcoin one click miner for mining vtc.

Pros: Passive Income
Cons: Electricity bill

2.Coinbase Rewards

Really easy to do, made around $50.

Pros: Easy
Cons: None

3.Crypto Royale

Fun game, made $10.

Pros: Easy, fun
Cons: None

Some Risk Involved Methods

1.Day trading

It can be easy, just don’t loose money, never sell at a lower price, made $10 (I didn’t have much money to start with). You can use binance for day trading.

Pros: Can make a lot of money
Cons: Requires money to start with, Some risk involved

2.Staking/Farming

You can stake stable coins on binance, made $10 (I didn’t have much money to start with)

Pros: Passive income
Cons: Some risk involved (little to no risk when staking stable coins)

Other ways to earn money (not crypto)

1.Survey sites

I use isay, made $100 just from doing them in my free time. Minimum withdraw is £5, you can withdraw in giftcards or virtual credit card.

Pros: No risk
Cons: You don’t get payed in crypto

2. Now use Presearch as your search engine in combination with Brave, it'll take a very long time to cash out but if you're consistent it's totally free crypto just for ""googling"" things like normal. 
3. Try Theta's cache worker, it pays you for acting as a content delivery network. Just put folding on idle! You'll receive t-fuel for uptime and bigger pay whenever streaming job comes through. Totally automatic and doesn't affect your performance. 
4. Less automated is Crypto Royale game, some earn up to $1 an hour but you must swap the roy for one on viperswap because cashing out through the game pays a fraction in comparison. 
5. You can use Nicehash to mine at home, gaming computers with newer Nvdia 3000 series can make $5 a day then just convert to coins you want. Laptops can overheat so keep that in mind.
6. If you're feeling really degen you can start turdposting on this sub, fortnite sub, or the Ethereum sub and earn the respective communities coin which when done effectively some claim to make $800 maybe more a month. Very time consuming.

heyheoy,"Forty-seven bankers were sentenced to jail time for their role in the financial crisis, Financial Times research has found, dispelling the myth that no one was held personally accountable for the financial sector’s catastrophic failures.

The FT searched records and news reports from across Europe and the US to uncover how many bank employees and directors recieved jail sentences for issues directly linked to the crisis or the collapse of their institutions.

The data does not include traders and other bank staff jailed for their role in interest rate rigging, like the two [Deutsche Bank traders jailed](https://www.ft.com/content/c970a0c0-8b53-11e8-b18d-0181731a0340) for interest rate rigging earlier this year, or for rogue trading not directly linked to the crisis or a bank collapse, like UBS’s Kweku Adoboli, who is now [facing deportation](https://www.ft.com/content/3c77180c-a1a6-11e8-85da-eeb7a9ce36e4).

Iceland had far and away the highest incidence of jailing, accounting for 25 of cases. The country seized control of its banks in October 2008 and imposed capital controls which ran for eight years to stave off chaos.

Chief executives, account managers, traders and chairmen from four banks were sentenced to term of between six months and five and a half years for everything from market manipulation to ‘gross breach of fiduciary duty’.

Luckily for them, Iceland has some of the [plushest jails](https://grapevine.is/mag/articles/2011/09/27/doingtimeiniceland/) in the world, with an ethos framed around rehabilitation rather than punishment. Prisoners are allowed flat screens TVs up to 26 inches, personal computers and games, and can apply to leave as often as once a month after they have served a third of their sentence.

Eleven Spanish bankers were sentenced to jail time for issues relating to Spain’s 2012 banking collapse, [most notably Rodrigo Rato](https://www.ft.com/content/7f93082e-f9ed-11e6-bd4e-68d53499ed71), the former head of the International Monetary Fund who chaired Bankia in the run up to its collapse.

Ireland, where the €67bn bank bailout bill forced the country into a sovereign bailout, jailed seven, but convictions of two bankers — Bernard Daly and Tiarnan O’Mahoney — were later quashed.

The most controversial was the case of Aoife Maguire, a former assistant manager at Anglo Irish Bank who was convicted of ordering the deletion of records relating to the accounts of former chief executive Sean FitzPatrick. Ireland’s Court of Appeal ultimately found her eighteen month sentence was “unnecessarily severe”, and shortened it to nine months, four of which were suspended.

The US, ground zero for the financial crisis, has jailed just one banker for issues relating to the crisis. Former Credit Suisse trader Kareem Serageldin was sentenced to thirty months in prison for artificially inflating the price of subprime mortgages, a financial product at the very heart of Wall Street’s unravelling.

Fit-Star-40,"So, there's a girl I was dating, and we parted, and as a parting gift she wanted me to gift her some nice necklace. She actually needed an iphone, but was not ready to accept such an expensive gift from me, as she felt bit uneasy accepting such an expensive gift.
And I didn't want to gift her jewellery, it just doesn't feel right to me somehow.
And after lots of thinking I finally decided that I'll gift her something that appreciates over time, and not depreciates, and might actually change her life down the line, unlike an iphone or a necklace. So, I decided to buy her a bitcoin (not a whole bitcoin ofcourse, I was in love, but not to that extent :-P). 
Thing is she's not at all into investments. So, one more reason behind gifting her a bitcoin was to introduce her to the world of investments, a world where she would rather have $1000 in stocks/cryptos, than an iphone.
So, I asked her to install Binance and get verified, so that I can transfer her her's bitcoin. (Before you guys starts judging ne, I feel my rationale behind the Binance selection instead of a private wallet should be self explanatory). 
And she's like, this is the most uncool gift ever. For a gift also you want me to do all the hardwork with downloading app, ID verification, and understand how things work? You SUCK!
Ofcourse, she understand my rationale behind gifting her this, atleast in theory, and didn't mean the above. And hopefully in future she will practically realise that this was indeed the best gift ever, and hopefully it changes her life for the better.

alligatormf,"Anyone can make a shitcoin, and I get that. Initially I don’t know how serious Shiba Inu was, but there’s zero doubt now that the developers and the community surrounding this coin fully intend to reinvent themselves into a legitimate technology offering.

Wtf am I talking about?

- SHIB developers created their own staking exchange with derivative coin offerings BONE and LEASH
- SHIB only NFT offerings are near or already launched (can remember which)
- Certik security score of 92%, which i believe is an integrity improvement from the initial launch

I also found an app where I can put in the SOL wallet address and it shows the NFT, so I know it’s there... but how do I transfer it now????
Help?! Please?! Anyone?!

Ok-Breakfast1,"As the bull market heats up, it is very tempting to go all-in or take reckless leverage (been there). As someone who survived the 2017 cycle, by the time the tulip mania really starts going, every shitcoin you see will sound like the next BTC / ETH, and you are already up so why not throw a bag at some nonsense project (I invested in 2017 in NEO because I thought it was the next Chinese ETH for this exact reason). Then eventually the music stops, and everyone thinks they can time the top but few do, and then you get rekt.

Before the mania really takes off, I recommend reading the book ""The Psychology of Money"".

Nuewim,"Many of us tend to listen to much to investing advices from people that never invested in their lives. Maybe they want well for you, but they have literally zero rights, zero knowledge  and zero evidence to support their opinions. They talk bullshit like most of the society about anything they have no idea about. They act like experts, when their situation  prove they can control even their own lives. Hell if full of people that had good intentions.

It is called Dunning-Krueger effect. People that know nothing or little about something tend to overestimate their skills, when masters with a lot of experience underestimate their skills and knowledge.  Just average uncle Joe that  would train national team better that professional trainer, govern country better than all politicians and know more how to make heart surgery than doctors that studied  medicine for 10 years, even if he have no education for any of those things. If you do not listen to people like that in everyday situations why the hell would you took any financial advices from them?

People who earn little more than  minimum wage, never invested in their lives, have 30k$ debt  and can't get promotion in job last 20 years will tell you investing in crypto is bad for your financial situation cause brother of friend of their postman invested in something in 1987 and lost everything.

Most people that achieve nothing are scared about anything new. Do not travel cause it is waste of money. Do not change job for better one, cause you will end under a bridge. Do not earn new languages do not invest. Do not do this or that. They just want you to have lfe like them. But ask yourself do you invest in crypto to really be like them or to achive something more?

If someone don't invest in anything especially not in crypto all their advices are worth nothing. They have no qualifications. And good intentions is not any reason to give advices about things you have no idea about. Better to took advices for real investors or business men that at least have some knowledge and achivement to support their opinions. Of course they are also not neutral. Everyone who invest  is biased in some way. That is why you can't have complains to anyone, DYOR is your responsibility.",0,"""You are never gonna be rich on crypto"".

I have solution to all of those problems. 110% proof. No bullshit, no scam, just straight forward action in any way in any direction you ever dreamed. I bet it sounds impossible but its not. This really works. Once inna lifetime quarantee. This is gonna bring you your Lambo in one week or less. In fact you are gonna make so mad gains you can buy Lambo for every day of the week for whole month. With enough capital you can buy whole damn Lambo factory.

INVEST IN ME

Yes. Invest in me. Pay me for manipulating market in a way no one can say market has been manipulated.

This is how it works;

I need to own some of that target crypto X. You want it dip? Let me put sell order to higher price, its a damn sure it will start dipping with that same second i press ""ok"" button. 100% sure price will start to avoid that higher price like it would have a ebola.

You need boost? All i need to sell that crypto X on some peak and start to wait lower price so i could fill my bags again. Its a damn sure it will launch to moon soon as i have sold that crypto. 

If you dont believe me, i have made good example about what i can do during last week. _Every single_ sudden massive boost or dip is my fault. I just used my method. They had nothing to do with luck or any other nonsense. 

To make sure you believe me i have made signature boost, i sold 100m Shib same day it started to boost. Not much, but thats not the point. Point is this really happens. I am the reason why different cryptos go suddenly up or down.

amandamichelle90,"For the past year, the sentiment around memecoin holders has been *”I feel bad for them — pouring their life savings into this and will lose it all”* but anyone still holding is likely into large profits on a few of them. They didn’t take your advice, they didn’t apply your logic and it worked out for them.

If you truly felt bad for them before, be happy that it worked out. If you’re upset for not doing what they did, that’s kinda silly.. coins pump everyday without us on board some of us just have a less chaotic strategy. 

This isn’t unique to crypto, people invest their time, energy and money into risky things that pan out all the time. In life there will be daily choices you make and don’t make that land you more or less money — it’s just less measurable than it is in Crypto, you’re less aware of the exact decision and what the alternative would have gained you.",0,Unless you read yesterday’s lotto numbers and sulk everyday for not picking them - don’t worry about coins that pumped without you
ObsoleteGentile,"It’s 100% OK to FOMO into a memecoin, so long as:

1.	You truly understand what it is, and are aware the money could disappear forever.
2.	You understand and observe risk management.

That’s it. Crypto is a way to enhance your future wealth and advance your retirement date. Play intelligently and responsibly and you will probably do that.

But it’s also pretty fun and exciting, especially for newcomers to the investment world. So why not have some fun, and take a small, non-life-changing moonshot now and then?

I’m not talking about risking half your portfolio, or even 10%. This is where the risk management comes in. Try maybe one or two percent of some recent gains. For example, say your responsible investments have made you $50K over the last two years. Feels good, right? Would $49.5K really feel that much worse??

That’s why during the DOGE run earlier this year I threw in 500 bucks, over a couple of buys, including one brief margin play. Worst case scenario is I’m out 1% of gains that were already…well, gains. House money. The play worked and I got out at the right time.

Had I invested everything, I’d be faced with the daily decision of which Aston Martin I would drive to look at new mansions. But no, it didn’t change my life. It gave me over $4000 in free money, though, and stopped me from feeling like I had entirely missed out on a big deal. I immediately put $3000 of that into safer investments and kept the rest for other fun plays. Now I’ve got a decent position on another shitcoin.

Even if that position is worth 5 figures now, I could lose it all by holding. But if I do, what have I really lost? Answer: 25% of 1% of some gains I made in my much larger positions in more responsible investments. And the whole time those responsible positions have been there, poised for my future.

So while you’re perfectly free to say NO on principle to memecoins at any amount, under any circumstances, just remember: this decision is purely personal. You’re not hurting the meme coin by staying out, and you’re not “helping crypto stay respectable,” because no matter what you think, there are more than enough boneheads kamikaze-ing into shitcoins that your abstinence has no bearing. It’s just you doing you.

But if you feel like potentially throwing away a half percent or so of your gains, you might just end up with sushi money. For a whole year. Which ain’t nothin’.",0,FOMO is fine

I plan to invest in some more coins, but I’m wondering how far to go. I’m a middle age, low-mid income guy with a family, so I don’t have a lot of money to toss around. I’m hoping to dodge working till I die, and at my age, a 401(k) ain’t the way. Bear in mind, I’m a small-time investor looking at (and hoping for) the long term. Think $100/month or so.

I’m currently in XLM. Planning to sink my spare dollars in until I can stake. Thinking ADA, ALGO, and ETH for the future; same plan, pile into one until I can stake, then move to the next. I’m considering ETH to be more or less stable, so I want *some* money in there.

Dogecoin is #9 with a **$32.6 billion market cap**, Shiba is #12 with a **$17.5 billion market cap** while most of the people cry hard about how crypto is about *future, technology, decentralization, freedom* and what fucking not.

&amp;#x200B;

I know that we're all here mostly because we want a better life and gains are still gains, but is this really it? We have a lot of projects in this market that would actually *deserve* a better spot, with teams that are working really hard to develop something useful and important yet they don't have even half the market cap of these shitholes.

savage-dragon,"**Alright lemme shill you a real solid coin:**

\- 30% of supply minted this year alone

\- Loses 99% of value since the genesis block

\- Minted by 1 single node

\- Node controlled by anon dev team

\- Currency can be mined in toxic mines with shitty ethics and pretty shitty fellow miners

The joke here is that what I'm shilling you is simply the US dollar, or any fiat currency for that matter. All the skills that have come intuitively to you while researching a cryptocurrency, stuff like max supply, market cap, issuance rate, issuance proofs, hash functions, token burns, etc.? These are the sorts of skills that fiat dev teams wish you never learnt, because they know if you ever did, you'd be up in arms.

 *It is well enough that the people of the nation do not understand our banking and monetary system, for if they did, I believe there would be a revolution before tomorrow morning.* 

   *--- Henry Ford*

Those are just the skills you learned intuitively the first day into crypto. Those are just skills related to fiscal policies.

If you never studied economics or business or finances in university, don't worry, because when it comes to fiscal policies, most university only shove basic stuff down your throats and regurgitate the same bullshit that's been going on since the Nixon era. They simply tell you that this Keynesian method is the norm nowadays without telling you its flaws. They never explain to you why only 1 single node gets to control the amount of fiat mined. They never explain to you why dev team is mostly anon. They simply want you to accept things as they are and as they will always be. 

Cryptocurrency gives you the firsthand experience as to why things are bad the ways they were and that things don't always have to be this way.

**But what about other skills? Aside from fiscal policies, what else have you learned that you take for granted in crypto?**

Keep in mind that the majority of adult Americans are basically financially illiterate, and believe it or not, Americans already represent the peak of humanity's education. (In coming hurr durr dumb American jokes from Europeans for sure) But let's move on.

How many people do you know are dumb as rocks when it comes to money management? How many constantly take on debts, live way above their means, have no savings or safety nets, waste money on drug addiction, gambling and poor decisions?

Now let's see what crypto has taught us during the bootcamp courses:

DCA. Sacrifice today for a 1000x better future. Don't let banks steal your yields, take charge of your yields. Research into each crypto's portfolio. 

Plus other financial tools and concepts like: reading charts, margins, leverages, future contracts, intellectual property ownerships, cryptography, safe online hygiene, macroeconomics models, technical analyses, etc.

Unless you were already in stock before crypto, these concepts are completely foreign to you. The stock market has a higher barrier to entry than crypto, and the majority crypto people in their early 20s without any prior financial experience had to learn all these concepts themselves. Were it not for crypto, many of these people would have been stuck working a normal job, not giving a shit about the global money market or any of these financial concepts.

**So yes winning in crypto is awesome. But keep in mind that crypto has already armed you with an extremely powerful knowledge. Remind yourselves that this knowledge had been hidden to 99% of the public prior to the advent of crypto. By being so transparent with its monetary policies, crypto has exposed how non-transparent and corrupt the fiat world is.**",0,"Whether you 'win' from crypto or not, crypto has taught a generation valuable financial skills that neither school nor 9-5 jobs would have managed to.

[Sentinel (dVPN)](https://sentinel.co/) is a network of independent dVPN applications and is build upon Cosmos-SDK. There is an Android app named [Velocity VPN](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=vpn.proxy.velocity) that uses dPVN to provide free VPN services. They support staking and are currently giving up to \~61% APY. Staking is supported at Cosmostation and Keplr Wallets. The project claims open source code and encrypted, permissionless and  censorship resistant VPN networking. According to the project's website, they will be supporting bandwidth mining, where you can share your internet bandwidth to earn rewards (somewhat similar to [Mysterium](https://mysterium.network/)). Project is still in its early stages and currently only major CEX listing is on KuCoin and DEX listing on [Osmosis](https://app.osmosis.zone/).

# Technical:

***How to read the table:***

* The rank represents the times the crypto was mentioned in this sub.
* The values on bearish and bullish columns are the ratio of bullish or bearish comments to how many times the coin was mentioned.
* Reliability index  is percentage of strongest sentiment (except neutral) with respect to all sentiments in the comments and averaged over all the comments. It can also be seen as average sentiment distribution (per comment) for the coin.
* Change 7D (%) is the percentage change in the price of the cryptocurrency in last 7 days.

***Methodology:***

*For Sentiment Analysis:*

* Data collection for sentiments (comments) are performed everyday at 12PM UTC -8:00.
* The comments with less than 6 words are not included in the analysis anymore as many research papers argue them to be low quality sentiments.
* Another filter that is applied that a post or comment should at least have 2 or more upvotes to be included in analysis for this table.
* For this analysis, only one mention of a coin/token per user is considered.
* The sentiment analysis is performed using lexicon model and natural language processing ([nltk](https://www.nltk.org/) module for python).
* Emojis are also considered in sentiment analysis and are demojizied using [Python emoji library](https://github.com/carpedm20/emoji/).

*For WordCloud and n-gram:*

* A word cloud (aka a tag cloud) is **a visual representation of words** in a picture format. These representations are used to highlight popular words based on frequency and relevance.
* An N-gram means a sequence of N words. For example, for 1-gram or unigram, we consider the frequently occurring single words, for 2-gram or bigram, a sequence of two words and similarly a 3-gram or trigram a sequence of 3 words. They are basically a set of co-occurring words within a given text or in this case, this subreddit.
* For the wordcloud and n-gram analysis, all the comments (without any filters) are collected and popular stop words are removed using ([nltk](https://www.nltk.org/) module for python).
* N-gram analysis is performed using  WordNetLemmatizer from nltk module for python.

***Feedback request***:

* Previous posts with ""Fun Fact"" section is renamed to ""Low Cap Radar"". This section will be used to provide weekly updates on some of the low cap cryptos with interesting use cases. OP is no where affiliated to any of these projects.

summerlad86,"Okay so I need some help because I don't know where to start.

Im sorry if this question should be posted elsewhere.

&amp;#x200B;

I have lived in Japan for x years. last year I opened an account on Binance.

On Binance Ive got some crypto (not what ppl would consider a lot but still). These were bought using my Japanese bank account and whilst living and working in Japan.

&amp;#x200B;

Now!

I do not want to pay the tax on crypto here since it is insanely high. Ludacris.

If I decide to leave the country, move back home and cut ties with Japan, do Japan still have the right to tax my income that I have made on the crypto? Since historically, most purchases was made whilst living in Japan and through a Japanese bank.

&amp;#x200B;

Im from a nordic country. My country and Japan has a "" double tax "" arrangement. Meaning that I can not be taxed by both countries for my income. This isapplied to salary and stocks. But! since Crypto is still relatively new I have tried to seek answers from someone that has done something similar but has not been able to find anything.

To give an example. In my home country I have stocks. I sold them. Only taxed in my home country.

Since Binance does not have the right to conduct business in Japan, I would assume that this might also be one of the key factors when coming to not wanting to pay tax for it in Japan... perhaps.

When cashing out from Binance, where does the money come from? Is it a transaction from the HQ in the Seychelles?",0,Taxes question regarding cashing out from Binance.

paulrudder,"I asked for recommendations on here last week for tracking DeFi transactions, and Koinly seemed to be the most highly endorsed. So I figured I'd try it out.

I went to Trust Wallet and clicked on my BSC scan address, then exported my 11 transactions to a CSV file. Then I uploaded that to Koinly and it auto imported everything.

But I have two questions I'm hoping I can get guidance on:

- every transaction shows up as a BNB withdrawal, even though I swapped bnb for alt coins a couple times. Is this accurate? Is every swap shown in BNB because that's the ""root"" coin I used? I guess I was confused why, for example, I cashed out my Baby Doge but I don't see any transactions with baby doge in the title. They all are labeled bnb withdrawals.

- should I include all 11 of my transactions even if some of them were purchases for coins I'm still holding? For example if I include a swap for an altcoin but I haven't sold it yet, would I include the purchase info on this year's tax return or ONLY include it once I do eventually sell the coin? I guess the reason I'm confused is that let's say I decide to hold a coin for 2yrs and then sell it... If I've already included the purchase / cost basis in this year's tax return then wouldn't the cost basis need to be reported again when I sell? So I'd be listing the purchase this year and again two years from now to show what the cost basis was?

Sorry if these are dumb or confusing questions. I know this isn't a tax accountant hangout, but since there are lots of other people who do their crypto taxes here, I thought I may at least get educated replies. I don't think accountants in my conservative town have much experience with crypto /DeFi so I may need to look for some kind of online accounting firm or a chain if people here aren't sure of the answers.",0,Question about Koinly / taxes

Im seeing a lot of disorganization when it comes to explaining the risk behind Shiba especially in the midst of such a rally. I wanted to give some insight into some risks that might have not been considered by some. 

To start I want to reference a video: 
https://youtu.be/r6k7kNr3Q3w

TLDR: The issuing of currency by private banks was a thing around the 1800s closely resembling crypto today. Easy to access capital requirements to open a bank as a business allowed anyone to issue actual curency exchangeable at banks that issued the notes much like a dex. At the peak of the Free Banking era there were roughly 16,000 banks issuing their own notes. The Federal Reserve was created to reign in 'Tiger Banks' who were known for predatory practices. 

So you might be wondering.. what does that have to do with anything? If we have learned anything its that history repeats itself, and we are walking into some shifty waters when it comes to the Ripple court case.

Now dont get me wrong but if that whole case is about disproving that there is an expectation of earnings when purchasing crypto as a contract then thats a tough argument to fight even if were supposedly winning against the SEC. 

https://coinmarketcap.com/crypto-heatmap/

If you look at the categorization of the different coins through cmc youll notice that BTH is called a Store of Value, which when compared does seem like just a currency, with no expectation of returns.

Smart Contracts though? thats rough waters. To say that hodlers of ADA or VET arent 'holding equity of Cardano or VeChain' is a long reach particularily when you look at how they are defined when compared to a traditional security.

Lets bring my points back full circle, because upon a simple glance of Shiba subreddits, to say that there is no exprctation of earnings from shib holders or shib shillers is.. astronomically false.

The institutions that monitor crypto define it best themselves. The cdc heatmap calls shib a memecoin. 

All my points demonstrate that were still remarkably early in cryptos life cycle if compared to history, but its also the wild west of unregulated financial systems, which is great for huge gains but opens up massive risk. 

Shiba and Doge in themselves may be genuine in their beliefs, and managed well enough to not have made the explicit mistake of 'promising gains' that which crosses the line of expectation of earnings, but at its core it is a vehicle to amass wealth, and it is observable by the cesspool of alt cloins that have spawned around shiba.

Im talking coins like Dogebonk, Bone, Dogenomics, BabyShiba, Shibanova, Shiba Floki, Floki Shiba, Minifloki, BabySpaceFloki etc..

These coins have listings on subreddits like 'cryptomoonshots' explicitely promising returns. 

They expose the whole crypto industry and are a massive risk to the credibility of our investments.

I dont want you guys to think im just upset about missing a wave, im sure by this point the experienced investors are used to this type of volatility and everyone has their say to get gains, but the whole category of memecoins is a unignorable vulnerability to the credibility of crypto as a whole and should be discouraged.",0,The true risk behind Shiba

Scary_Milk,"I‘m not into any TA (technical analysis) stuff, graph interpretation, moon phases or astrology in terms of crypto.

I‘m a classical holder, do my own research when something covers my intention and if I‘m convinced, I invest and just hold. Every coin and token has it‘s time if it‘s a good project and pump and dumps don’t interest me, I‘m here for the long term values.

But since everything is coupled to Bitcoin in crypto and a dumping BTC takes everything down into the abyss, it‘s good to know when BTC peaks to park your investments into a stablecoin until the market starts to recover to have some extra gains.

The index I follow for that cycle tops, which I discovered at my first BTC dump in 2018 is the pi cycle top indicator. It‘s crazy accurate and predicted every cycle top within three days. And yes, also the last cycles top in april 2021.

I don’t even understand the tech side, for your interest: It uses the 111 day moving average (111DMA) and a newly created multiple of the 350 day moving average, the 350DMA x 2. When the 111DMA moves up and crosses the 350DMA x 2 we see that it coincides with the price of Bitcoin peaking. 

The name pi comes from 350 / 111 = 3.153, which is very close to Pi = 3.142. 

For me, it worked very good for the past two cycles and I‘m watching it closely. It’s looking very good right now for BTC by the way and we‘re still at the beginning of this cycle if you believe in Pi.

Do your own research, it‘s just my observation and opinion and I hope it helps someone.

XLMisthebest,"In the grand scheme of things I'm still pretty new to the world of crypto. I did a lot of research and decided that I'd play it a bit safe and generally go for long term steady gains.


The one thing I read a lot of was that you need to have a strategy and try to stick to it, I also read a lot of pro DCA comments I'm sure there's people with better strats than mine, but here's what I've been doing.


Step one: DCA in and out with coins that generally trend up over time.


For this, I picked coins in the top 20 or so and invested small amounts into them, slightly increasing my amounts as the price went down. I'd sell off once I was able to make a profit of a few USD buy trading fractions of it as the price started to rise and rinse and repeat. Although the amounts I was getting was relatively small, I would put it to one side and I quickly saw this pot add up.


Step two: Invest profits into long term holding projects.


Whenever I'd catch a coin that I liked and wanted to hold long term going down in value  I would invest the profits from my step one into these. I'd do this every week and just forget about it, basically just DCA in and hold.


So far I have made steady but decent long term profits doing this. I don't make massive gains off anything or really chase moonshots and since the money going into these long term holdings are all raised from profits taken from step one I'm literally investing what I can afford to lose which is nothing out of my salary.

I'm interested to hear what you guys do too.",0,"My crypto investing strategy, what's yours?"
slushkan3an,"I believe, in my opinion, that Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAOs) will not just revolutionize online communities but also create a whole new 'industry', especially when it comes to smart contracts and the subjective human, non-binary elements required to validate or invalidate a smart contract. 

Ok ... that was a mouthful. I am not really good at translating my thoughts to written words but I hope that this example helps: 

Let's look at Person A and Person B. 'A' wants to sell the house and 'B' wants to buy it. Usually, both 'A' and 'B' would have conditions and only if these conditions are met will the deal go through ... this is why we have 3rd party validators and ESCROW. 

'B' asks 'A' to do a some touch-ups and repairs before they buy the house. 'A' accepts but is worried that they do all this work/cost and then 'B' simply decides to pull out of the deal because they found a better one. 'A' asks 'B' to get a 3rd party validator (kind of like a judge that both parties will trust to be fair and objective) and place funds in an ESCROW. Once 'A' completes the repairs/touch-ups, the 3rd party will validate and release the funds in ESCROW from 'B' to 'A'. 

The argument for smart contracts is that they would be able to facilitate this whole thing in a much more efficient (automation), cost-effective (cheaper as there is no middle man fees) and trust-less manner. 

Let's say 'A' did the repairs and touch-ups as requested by 'B' however 'A' used the cheapest materials and labour ... basically just enough to meet the base requirements. Most 3rd party validators will not go way out of their way to validate the quality of the job (good/mediocre/bad) ... their incentive is to make the deal go through as fast as possible so that they get their fees. 

Ok ... so how is all of this related to smart contracts and DAOs?

Problem with smart contracts is that they are binary ... yes or no. Either something is validated or it is not. What about the subjective, human, non-binary elements like quality (which is more of a spectrum)? I think this is where DAOs come in. They would 'ride' on top of smart contracts and would help smart contracts validate non-binary things. For example, there could be a DAO (online community kind of like a subreddit) that specializes in homes/construction/interior design and its community of experts get to vote on subjective matters and get rewarded in crypto for their votes. This feeds the smart contract and the smart contract takes care of the rest. 

TLDR: I think that DAOs will be revolutionize the future of online communities and will be super essential for the adoption of smart contracts, especially for non-binary, subjective human perspectives.

With the start of the NBA season, we are seeing the first signs of mass adoption of NFT tickets collectibles in the NBA. This week Miami Heat announced that every ticket holder will receive a limited edition NFT of the FTX arena, after the ticket is scanned. When a twitter user called out Mark Cuban that he is suprised Miami Heat beat the Dallas Mavericks to NFT tickets.

**Cuban**

Cuban has said the Mavericks were trying to find a good option for turning our tickets into NFTs. He is interested in increasing the revenue from ticket sales and maximizing the experience for fan using NFTs. The possibillity to ask royalties on NFT tickets is a great feature to increase revenue from ticket sales by getting a royality on secondary market sales. Cuban noticed season ticketholders will sell their tickets for a few high demand to pay for their wholse season ticket package. With a royality fee on NFT tickets sold on secondary market sales, the Mavericks will profit aswell from secondary market sales. 

**Adoptiong is already happening** 

major ticketing companies like **Ticketmaster and Seatgeek** are actively working on implementing NFT ticketing. Ticketmaster recently launched a FAQ for its NFT ticket marketplace. Seatgeek hired a blockchain executive as VP of engineering and Seatgeek plans to roll out NFT ticketing for the NFL and NBA. 

Which projects are working on NFT ticketing?

**GET protocol – 50m usd (+- rank 600 coingecko)**

**GET protocol** has been working on blockchian ticketing since 2016 and had its ICO in 2017. GET protocol offers existing and new ticketing companies tools to easily implement NFT ticketing. GET protocol has recently crossed the **1 million NFT tickets sold** mark. **9 ticketing companies** are using GET protocols NFT ticketing solution so far. The recently announced YourTicketProvider, which sells 2 million tickets annually. What I really like is that all tickets can be tracked on NFT ticket explorer.

Furthermore, the tokenomics of GET protocol create value for tokenholders. Ticketing companies that use GET protocol for NFT ticketing need to buy GET from the openmarket. The GET tokens that paid for usage of the protocol get transferred to the DAO. Tokenholders decide what happens with the funds of the DAO (burn the token, marketing etc). This proces is currently done manually. Automated on-chain tokenomics is currently in the last test phasing and will likely be announced at the end of the month. A technical overview of the flow of tokens used as fuel for the GET protocol can be read from the link below.

“I was born in 1994 in Russia and moved to Canada in 2000, where I went to school. I happily played World of Warcraft during 2007-2010, but one day Blizzard removed the damage component from my beloved warlock's Siphon Life spell. I cried myself to sleep, and on that day I realized what horrors centralized services can bring. I soon decided to quit.”

So the reverse DCA. For example, you have decided that you want to start profit taking and sell some of your BTC. So you think about when you want to sell and how much of it. So you sell some of your BTC at $65K. But then the BTC continues to rise to $70K so you sell another fraction there.   


The maths: 2 BTC at $65K is $130K.  
One BTC at $70K and one at $65K is $135K.

It is my 1 year into crypto and I am happy that I've been investing.
As a small poor guy I do not have much money to save, all what I invest into crypto is the money I would otherwise use to pay for cigarettes and other smoking stuff.

When I've started to invest, my goal, besides making profit, was  financial freedom. I always only wanted to invest what I could afford to lose and never invested more than that...

only problem is that I had no money left at the end of a month. Trying to solve that dilemma I went through all my expenses and saw that the only way to get extra fiat for crypto is to stop smoking.

kwadoss,"Since 2018 I've been working on the creation of a *Protocol for* ***Open Source Medical research without intellectual property*** *aka the* **Etica Protocol**. [https://www.eticaprotocol.org](https://www.eticaprotocol.org/)

As Victor Hugo puts it so well:  ***""Nothing is More Powerful than an Idea Whose Time has Come""***

I think the time for Etica has come, so let me share a brief presentation of Etica with you.

**Brief presentation:**

Etica aims to promote ***open source medical research without intellectual property***. It incentivizes ***publication of research oriented papers*** (by professionals or not) for each disease added to the network.

Etica protocol has its own currency Etica (*ETI*). The protocol has a fixed inflation of about 2.5% per year. Thanks to this inflation it funds the *curation rewards (for voters)* and *editor rewards (for creators of proposals)*.

It operates based on periods of 7 days. For each period a *curation\_reward* as well as an *editor\_reward* will be issued by the Protocol (respecting the 2.5% yearly inflation rate). For each period all users can submit *Proposals* in order to get a part of the *editor\_reward*  of the period. Etica token holders can submit and vote on proposals  using a staking system (They have to lock Eticas for 28 days in exchange  for ***bosoms***). Bosoms are a unit of measure inherent to the protocol that is used by the voting system. All proposals can be voted upon for ***3 weeks.*** *After the voting duration has been passed the Protocol rewards or penalises participants based on the outcome of the votes.*

The protocol is designed in such a way that **only about 72% of proposals will be accepted**. Thus due to open source competition the creators of proposals will have to **improve the quality of their papers** to get a proposals accepted by the network as things progress

*The  creator of a proposal that was accepted by the network will be rewarded  with a part of the period's editor\_reward that will be proportional to  the amount of Eticas that was used by token holders to vote on the  proposal. If the proposal is rejected, depending on the level of the  rejection the creator of the proposal will have it's stack duration  increased (for instance 65 days) or even lose funds (to submit you have  to put a collateral of 10 ETI that you can lose if proposal is heavily  rejected by the network).*

The  voters that vote on the wining side (can be either accepted or  rejected) will get a part of the curation\_reward proportional to the  amount of Eticas they have used to vote on the proposal. If they vote on  the losing side, their stack will be increased (for instance 84 days  longer) in proportion to the level of rejection.

Full details in the whitepaper.

***The whitepaper:***

The  Etica whitepaper (9 pages) describes how the protocol will operate in  details. (As Published and sent to the original Satoshi Nakamoto mailing  list in September 2019)

[https://eticaprotocol.org/viewwhitepaper](https://eticaprotocol.org/viewwhitepaper)

[The smart contract:](https://github.com/etica)

The Etica smart contract is on [github/etica](https://github.com/etica). It is a complexe **smart contract that successfully implements everything described in the whitepaper**  in the form of an Ethereum smart contract. If you are a developper or  you know ethereum developpers tell them to review this smart contract. I  have full confidence they will assess the quality of the code.

Etica is all about open source and **creating a community based project** **with nobody having specific privileges**.  Even if I started to work on Etica alone,  I understand the potential  of this project, it is much bigger than me and to succeed ***it needs to be completely decentralised from day 1***.

This is why I want to underline these facts:

1. I plan to **launch Etica in coming months from scratch as soon as there will be a community**
2. There will be **no premine**
3. Anybody joining Etica will have same rights, aka **I won't have any privilege nor anybody else**
4. It is completely **open source**
5. It is a neutral protocol
6. There is no backdoor Key or Key with specific rights
7. The smart contract will be launched **on its Blockchain (a Fork of Ethereum Proof of work)**
8. The initial supply will be distributed trough mining
9. **Mining will stop forever once we reach 21 Million Eticas (should take several years)**
10. Then only the yearly inflation of 2.5% will generate new Eticas

With all my compassion for victims I can't imagine how dumb and irresponsible you need to be to tell poor and potentialy dangerous people you have a lot of  money and park sport car in slums. Informations like that move like lightening in bad neighbourhoods. In few days everyone will know it, drug addicts, homeless people, gangs, murderers, thiefs etc. Everyone can imagine  how it will end.


I am poor, I would never tell in my neighbourhood if I would have life changing money. I would just move out  to better neighbourhood and never come back.  I am one of them cause I am poor, if I would be rich all my neighbours and friends would hate me. I am already a freak cause I study at university. Everyone who is different in places like this, so want to have better life earn more money, be educated either move out quietly someday or lose everything, cause they told it to wrong person.


If you want to ""show off"" your wealth, so buy expensive things like iphone, brand clothes etc. better to move to normal neighbourhood, where having 2k$ phone is not death sentence. If you want to have mansion and lambo then move to rich neighbourhood, where people will be rich like you, and they will not want to steal your money and things.

If you're actually giving financial advises, then your disclaimer is useless and doesn't change the content of your post.

When I say dollar it’s actually a CPI dollar in 2019 so actually it presently targets around $2.05.

450 divided by 12 months = 37,50 paid out at the end of each month

After the 1st months payout you will have a total of =

5,037.50

In the second months payout, the 37.50 you earned the first time around, will net you even more interest = 37.78 and your total will be 5,075.28

Third month = 38.06 and your total will now be 5,113.34

This is called compound interest, hopefully, you get the gist of it

Compare this to your local banks savings account and you get 0.03% interest a year, LOL

There are blockchain bulls who argue that the power used for mining is by utilizing unused power or from renewable power. There's El Salvador using volcanoes for mining when the same electricity could be used for something less taxing like proof of stake and household use. 

There is excess GPUs out there, ready to be dumped on the market when ETH goes fully proof of stake. There is carbon footprint for every excess GPU that was made and don't forget about ASIC miners.

You don't need big warehouses and excess power for proof of stake. So these warehouses that were constructed for this purpose contributed to the carbon footprint.

All the excess accessories like pcie risers, PSUs, motherboards, ethernet cables or wifi does contribute to the overall carbon footprint. This will seem petty to a lot of people, by you just need 1 PC running a single or multiple virtual machines to mine any coin that you like with proof of stake and people with existing hardware can do so.

chedebarna,"Many people will freak out, but I think this is becoming a more popular opinion as figures like Michael Saylor insist on it and spread it.

It is OK to take a bank loan to buy crypto. Under the right circumstances.

First and foremost, as a conditio sine quae non, the loan needs to be repayable even if you lose 100% of the investment. This is akin to the trading advice of not overleveraging. If you have to go without food to pay back your monthly installment, you did it wrong.

I think it's common sense, but we all know about that, so I felt I had to spell it out.

Personally, I took a personal loan that takes less than 10% of my monthly income to pay back. I could have borrowed more, but I just didn't want to. The payback period is 96 months.

This for me is the equivalent of DCAing that amount of less than 10% of my income every month for 8 years, which I think is a treshold used by many people who DCA.

I just used the loan to accelerate this and be able to do a lump sum investment instead to benefit from higher returns from the earlier investment.

The price I pay for that is the loan interest, which at the current rates, compared against the upside of crypto, made it a no brainer.

Now, about what to do once you've accumulated enough profits to pay the loan back in one go and get rid of it... Do not.

Your debt in fiat depreciates every day. And you won't get any discount for paying it off earlier. As a matter of fact, you will usually be penalized.

For example, I am in year 2 of my 8-year loan. I could already pay everything back, principal and interests, with my crypto profits, and be done with that... But early payment incurs a 1% penalty.

Ridiculous, I know. Welcome to modern ""banking""!

Also, why would I want to pay now, when we all know that 1 dollar today is worth easily 1.5 dollars of 2028? Think about the things you could buy with 1000 bucks 8 years ago, and the milleage you get today. And it's just getting worse.

So no, you want to drag ever-depreciating fiat loans for as long as possible in fact -- while accumulating ever-appreciating (at least for the next 10-15 years) crypto.

Now, a similar reasoning works for the previous question that led me to the conclusion that borrowing was the way.

Why DCA in small sums, when you know that in the long run the trend goes up? You want to be a bit careful about the specific moment you throw in the lump sum of course. Try to find a dip. But even if you bought at the peak, if you give it enough time, it's likely that eventually you get a higher return than just DCAing.

Finally, the bit I think will be most controversial, because thisnis Reddit and we're here to play:

If you're young, asset-less, and have a 4 or 5 figure sum to invest (for instance by borrowing it), ignore the ""you should diversify"" crew.

If you have concluded (correctly) that crypto is a good investment that outperforms any other known asset class, why malinvest on purpose? That's not being cautious, but being incompetent.

Diversifying into low or even negative yield assets sounds like the type of eccentricity millionaires can afford, not young working people with no assets who are trying to generate and protect generational wealth starting from 4 or 5 figures.",0,Taking a loan to buy crypto may be OK
Drstrangelove2014," More precisely, **Cryptocurrencies** are **proof that humanity's relationship with money is similar to religion.**

To prove a religion exists, I simply ask the following questions:

* Does the religion have a leader?
* Does the religion have followers?
* Does the religion have beliefs?
* Does the religion have rituals?
* Does the religion have places of worship?

When you put it like this, it is easy to show how basic principles of Bitcoin line up with these five factors.

This is how cryptocurrencies work:

* Bitcoins have no individual as a **leader**. However, a leader does not have to be necessarily an individual, but a function. In this case, the function of ""leader"" is filled by Bitcoin's algorithm, which acts as the ruler that governs the entire currency and network. The result: a robotic leader.
* Following Bitcoin are **miners and holders**. These people actively participate in the religion of Bitcoin and ascribe to the belief that it is a universal currency.
* Bitcoin has core **beliefs**. The main one is that it is a global currency, can't be controlled and is a payment system that is superior to all others.
* Bitcoin has **rituals**. Sending a transaction is a ritual, as is storing your Bitcoins somewhere. Keeping your wallet safe is a ritual. Mining is a ritual.
* Bitcoin has **a place of worship**, which is the exchanges. Exchanges act as a point of contact for people to communicate, trade, and engage with the religion of Bitcoin.

In fact, if you have any cryptocurrencies, you are actively participating in a social structure that has a one-to-one correspondence to a religion.

* *We don't need to convert every person in the world to our way of thinking.*

Cryptocurrencies are proof that you can have a universal currency without any centralized body controlling it.

&amp;#x200B;

CoinMarketCap, a price-tracking website for cryptocurrencies, has reportedly fallen victim to a hack that leaked 3.1 million (3,117,548) user email addresses. 

The information came into light after the hacked email addresses were found to be traded and sold online on various hacking forums, and [revealed](https://haveibeenpwned.com/PwnedWebsites#CoinMarketCap) by Have I Been Pwned, a website dedicated to tracking hacks and compromised online accounts.

CoinMarketCap, confirmed that the list of leaked user accounts matched its userbase:

 **“CoinMarketCap has become aware that batches of data have shown up online purporting to be a list of user accounts. While the data lists we have seen are only email addresses, we have found a correlation with our subscriber base.”** 

 

While confirming the correlation of the 3.1 million (3,117,548) user email addresses with its userbase on Oct. 12, the company has assured that the hackers did not gain access to any of the account passwords. “We have not found any evidence of a data leak from our own servers — we are actively investigating this issue and will update our subscribers as soon as we have any new information,” CoinMarketCap spokesperson said.

Despite the confirmation, CoinMarketCap has yet to identify the exact cause of the hack. Responding to Cointelegraph's request for comment, CoinMarketCap [said](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/article/good-security-habits):

&gt;**""As no passwords are included in the data we have seen, we believe that it is most likely sourced from another platform where users may have reused passwords across multiple sites.""**

slywalkers,"On August 18, the body of the student, originally from Tours , was found in a pond in Planche-Bas, a small town located in the east of Haute-Saône. The autopsy revealed more than twenty stab wounds to the neck and torso, none of which was fatal, which makes it possible to consider ""a session of torture"", according to the magistrate. They had to torture him to give out his private keys.

When the corpse was discovered, the 30-year-old companion had first declared to the gendarmes to have been the target, with the student, of a homophobic attack, before admitting during his police custody to have participated in the assassination, with the two young people of 18 and 23 years old. The trio acknowledged their involvement, ""even if no one assumes having given the stab wounds,"" said the prosecutor. And the suspects eventually revealed that the twin brother and his wife helped them plan the crime.

TLDR:

There can be a perfect oracle network (perfect code, transparency, decentralization) but it is open to something called Sybil attack, where fake data can be profitable. This can be overcome but during that period of time, people will lose trust/traction in this network.

Chainlink solves this by using real-world reputation (banks, companies, etc) to make it a strong network initially and make it a high standard for the future so there's no scamming and therefore can build trust and gain traction from the start.

This post ends with that chainlink will consume all of the trust assurance industry, which I'm not totally sure. Basically everything that has to do with contracts and etc. //my opinion (and I'm not an expert by any means) is that while chainlink will be a big part of this, as it connects the real-world data to crypto world, there has been a lot of advancements since this original post which seems to be from 2019. I think it's more true that **crypto** will consume all trust assurance industry, and chainlink is one that cannot be missed in that world. I am very bullish chainlink and eth.

So in the situation above, could you say proudly that you've 10x'd your investment (or at a portion of it), or is that declaration only reserved for those who dumped a lump sump into a coin never to invest in it again, and/or for those who stopped DCA'ing at some stage, thereby easily determining that they 10x'd their total investment?",0,"What would be considered a 10x (or whatever ""x"")?"

I have numerous amounts invested in 40 coins. I'd like to capture my initial investment, but am wondering if I should capture way more? 

My current strategy (based on what I'm forecasting to at LEAST hit) is to sell off 15% of coins owned. That will give me my initial investment + 25% profit of initial investment and still holding coins for whatever happens next.

buttcoin_lol,"Some quick MOON math, data from Coingecko:

$0.14 price * 250,000,000 total supply = $35 million current market cap

I think MOONs will be at least a top 100 coin, based off of being one of the first social coins on a major social platform like Reddit. The #100 coin on Coingecko right now has about a $1 billion market cap. 

$1 billion / $35 million = ~28x of room to grow

$0.14 * 28 = $3.92

So: I think MOONs will break $1, and then much more, based of some pretty conservative estimates IMO. That's the crypto market right now; in a few years, I would think a top 100 coin will be more than $1 billion, and it's not unreasonable to think MOONs could reach $10, which would only be about ~$2.5 billion, which are a dime a dozen even now.",0,"Why I think MOONs can reach $10, based off of its supply and market cap"

The story:

Having a strong feeling that the bull run was no where close to being over I was quite sure Shib would have a new ATH in not too long of time. (Spoiler: it did)

I bought Shib after it bottomed out after the May pump at around .000006. It practically sat stagnant since then. After quite a few months of this, I'd be lying if I wasn't considering getting this bullShib off my hands. But, despite the constant hate and advice to sell on this sub, and the spirit of Satoshit, I held on.

Fast forward about 5 months later 

Pumptober hits and Shib gets a new support at .000025 - 28 range. From .000006 to . 000028! 

I log back on to my favorite subreddit, and shib is in nearly every post. 
""Well that's cool, ima click on one"", I say.
Result: dirty no-Shibers advising us to sell asap, get out of the pump, etc. 

Reddit is effective. I started to have paper hands, the spirit of Satoshi was slowly being replaced by the spirit of The Average Redittor, and I considered selling for a simple and lowly 4x. Still better than stocks of course, but not good enough for Satoshi or myself. I was scared. I was alone. I was becoming a Redditor.

BUT 

momma didn't raise no bitch. I grabbed my ballsack and held for dear life. 

Fast forward to today. Shib new ATH at .00003652, support strong at .000028, holding now at around .000036 with steady upward trend as I type.

Now sitting with over 6x on this shitcoin everyone advised me to sell a thousand times. 

Will I sell now?

No. 

Will I regret it?

Probably, but only after shib gets a few more ATHs

Will I listen to redditors?

I’m not saying this is good, KuCoin should be meeting demand if they want to avoid hurting customers, but they are not trying to commit fraud.

What is really happening here is KuCoin is likely not able to meet demand.

Now why can’t they handle the scale? It typically comes back to a weak point in the system: they don’t have auto scaling for their web servers (AWS will happily let you launch as many servers as you want, they want to make money) or their database instance isn’t sized correctly (you can’t just add more RAM to a database without some downtime).

The post proposes that geo load balancing can solve this. Sadly it cannot unless you are literally Amazon, Facebook or Google. Databases are unfortunately still very hard to run in multiple regions without giving up some characteristics that require them to replicate the data consistently amongst each other.

Let's verify this!

Go to the BscScan page for both the InfinitX CG listing (0x1f5d9ffafa57604ae2a43cebadecc175df2f069e) and the InfinitUP CG listing (0xc6f26e6df5f44c0ccd939581987c09b866cdbd1a), and then checking the Smart Contracts for both, which are both listed previously, and available on both CG and CMC.

Now compare the marketingFeeReceiver addresses, and copy+paste it (they're the same) into the BscScan search bar.  Look at the drop down menu showing what kind of tokens the wallet is holding.  This wallet has both IUP and INX!!

But wait, there's more!

If we look at the websites for both of these coins, and then scroll down to the Road Map, the Road Maps are virtually identical, with the exception of BNB being changed to XRP.  The dev even misspelled the word ""celebrities"" as ""celibrities"" in both websites. 

I'd very much like to be wrong about this, but the information is all publicly available, due to the Smart Contracts being open source.  I created a burner Discord account and joined the INX Discord server, and pointed all of this out, and the dev MoonP resorted to throwing insults and calling me poor.  At one point, they even said something along the lines of ""I'm a dev and that means I know better than you"", which solidifies my opinion that this is a rug pull.  I made a second burner Discord account, and joined the server, acting as a concerned investor, and was able to get MoonP to admit that the contract addresses I had provided earlier (on the first burner) were correct, from the pinned messages in that Discord server. 

&amp;#x200B;

I don't know if I have to say this, but I would like to stress that XRP and BNB have nothing to do with this aside from the fact that they were pegged to each coin on creation.  Also, this is not financial advice. Do your own research and verify yourself that the information I've provided is accurate.  I refrained from posting links or screenshots, but I will provide them if asked.  Or you can join the Discord server yourself (the link is on InfinitX's CG listing) and scroll up to about 7:20-7:30PM PST or so for the day of October 23 2021.",0,InfinitX is a rug pull (with proof you can verify yourselves)

# Why is ok to be involved in Crypto:

1. Despite the fact that this is a contentious point of view, many people hold the following belief:
2. Government money is a sin.
3. They believe this because they believe that inflation is a sin.
4. Inflation is the debasement and devaluation of one's currency.
5. And by doing so, the government is essentially stealing a small portion of their own citizens' money every year.
6. Breaking the eighth commandment, ""You shall not steal.""
7. Governments can print any amount of money at any time, devaluing their own people's money at any rate they choose.

As a Christian, if you believe this case to be true, then it is probably a good idea to get involved in the cryptocurrency space.

prajwalwillrule,"Story time,

Last snapshot I decided to fuel my trading addiction by doing a 1 month hodling+staking vs day/swing trading experiment. I started with 100$ because I'm broke af. 

Spent a few days turning that to about 130$

Then I finally thought to check out this Futures trading. I didn't know shit about fuck, so a quick YouTube tutorial and I put in the 30$ I made into it. Shiba was on fire back then and just starting to drop from ATH. 

With 10x Shiba Shorting, and some BTC, ALGO longs, I turned my 30$ to about 250$ in a week! That's about 8 times my investment. 

I came on this sub to brag and got a shitload of warning. The good part was I hadn't been liquidated in that 1 week.

My greed got the best of me and I started trading with bigger amounts(from 250$) and with 20x and 25x
I watched my profits in the position at 100s of $ and like a dumbass I went to sleep thinking I'll be a millionaire in a week this way.

Fast forward to next morning, I opened my eyes and saw 4 messages from Binance. They said my positions had been liquidated 😂

I was back to 15$ now. I made 8x in a week, and lost it in a night. 

I'm not warning you guys because I lost money overnight. I warn you because I got addicted so bad, I put in more money and lost more of it. 

Once you get a taste of how quickly you can make money  with high risks, it's hard to go back. This has turned me into a damn gambler, moving me from 15min charts straight to 3 min and 1 min charts.

**Tips for anyone looking into futures trading**

1. **DON'T**

Well, if you still wanna do it,

1. Take profits on time. 

2. Don't get greedy and increase your leverage too much. The ""volatility"" of crypto goes both ways, up and down. So don't get greedy and lose your money. 

3. Most coins follow BTC, keep a close eye on it. 

Having said that, I'm going back to my rabbit hole and try to get back my initial investment before quitting futures(no I'll seriously give up once I get my money back. I swear on Shiba coin)

I'll give you a life tip which you can tell the entire world, and the world will become a better place.

DCA, Stake, and HODL.

levi97zzz,"I discovered crypto earlier this year, and I have been deep in the rabbit holes for a few months now. One thing I have come to realized is that - if you are to fall in the rabbit hole the “right way”, meaning, do your own research about different coins/chains, it is more natural and makes more sense to be a maxis than to be a multi-chain. If you really do your own research, it takes a lot of time because not only do you need to read and understand the white paper, you also need to deeply immerse yourself in the community to have a better understanding of how the community works, read different posts/books and listens to hours of podcasts to understand the context of why the chain is created, what problems the chain is trying to solve etc… Once you finished your research, it is highly likely to be a maxis in the coin you just researched. I genuinely think that those who say they are a “multi-chain” supporter has to have a very macro pov (hence, not that technical and more financially focused) and doesn’t do a deep enough research in any chains.",0,"Unpopular opinion - It is easier and makes more sense to be a maxis, if you DYOR"
Un1ucki3st,"Hi all.

First post here, and I'll just say I know enough about crypto to be dangerous to my bank account and why it exists as a whole.

Outside of that, I'm basically clueless.

Right now I want to start transitioning from my ""trading only"" approach and actually holding my crypto myself and not on an exchange.

First of all, how would I do that and how do I not get scammed in the process?

Second, if I'm looking for quality news and discussion on crypto outside of this sub, where can I find it?

Third, where can I educate myself on crypto as a whole and its benefits to the world? I know YouTube is a good source of info, but I never know when I'm walking into a minefield with mixed truths and misleading statements. 

I'm guessing BTC is the big staple that everyone wants you to hodl, and ETH is probably a close second since they're the heavy hitters.

I do plan on continuing my trading on the side and participating in some Moon shots... but I feel that crypto I hold on my own and long term will be better for me than any short term gains that are held in an exchange.

Many_Scratch2269,"The US debt currently sits at more than 28 Trillion dollars. This is 140% of the US GDP. There is absolutely no way the US can pay this much debt off without devaluating the dollar. The US has already printed more than 50% of its dollar supply in the last 2 years alone. We are already seeing supply shocks happening and inflation rising.

It won't be stopping anytime soon either. The US keeps touching its debt ceiling faster and faster and the debt is rising exponentially. 

https://preview.redd.it/o0bl8z7u8bv71.jpg?width=910&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7f9110b2bca502cfdb3d2ddc7f37801609f4f6f2

Just in case you forgot earlier, in order to pay this debt, the US will have to devaluate the dollar significantly. Guess what happens when the US dollar devaluate? Other countries will also follow. 

**Currencies pegged with the US dollar**: Aruban florin, Bahamian dollar, Bahraini Dinar, Barbadian dollar, Belize dollar, Bermudian dollar, Cayman Islands dollar, Cuban convertible peso, Djiboutian franc, East Caribbean dollar, East Timor centavo coin, Eritrean Nakfa, Hong Kong dollar, Jordanian dinar, Lebanese pound, Netherlands Antillean guilder, Omani rial, Panamian balboa, Qatari riyal, Saudi riyal, United Arab Emirates dirham, Venezuelan bolivar.

The takeaway from this is that Cryptocurrencies are going to be extremely valuable in the future. You probably already know this, but Crypto is going to be more valuable than what you currently think because not only is there significant inflation already, it is only going to get worse as countries have to pay off their debt. 

The US isn't alone in their debt crisis however. Almost every country has to inflate away their debt. The inflation we are seeing currently is nothing considering what might come in the future.

How do you think the world is going to pay all this debt off? Short answer, it can't. Inflation is going to be huge. Crypto is currently the best way to avoid inflation. Crypto literally has deflationary currencies right now while some countries are facing severe inflation. Crypto is one of your only bets to survive the coming inflation. The inflation we are seeing currently is severely underestimated as the CPI doesn't count the housing market and other assets that have ballooned in the last 2 years alone.

TLDR: Countries are going to have to inflate their currencies to pay off their debt (especially after the pandemic, we are already seeing a huge inflation rise) and one of the only ways you can avoid inflation and take advantage of the situation is to invest in Crypto. Invest while you can because inflation will ruin your financial condition in the future if you keep holding your wealth in fiat.",0,"The US Dollar has to devaluate significantly in order for the US to pay off its debt.

Couple of months back my friend encouraged me to get in to crypto. As an entry point, he told me to setup my account on Binance. 
Slowly and steadily, I got into what coins to invest in based on different YouTube videos (which explains the project) and the posts here (Thank you to everyone). 
Couple of weeks back, I understood that binance is centralised and hence, discouraged by the community. 
I would like to know the best alternate to Binance. 
Obviously, I have two basic requirements :
- Should work on all platforms (Mac, iOS, Android, Windows), yes, I use all. 
- Should be easy to stake coins",0,Alternate to Binance

Hi Guys I am relatively new to Crypto. I have solana decs and fantom decs as well as new Icos which I have purhased on relatively new exchanges as these new ICOS seem to come out on these new exchanges. Can you suggest what is the safest way to keep them?

I am under the impression that only the layer 1s and possibly layer 2s can be kept on hardware wallets.

can you keep ANY TOKEN ON YOUR HARDWARE WALLET Including new ico tokens? I am new to crypto so would be great to get some ideas.

Thanks to everyone in advance.",0,Can you keep new ICO tokens in hardware wallets like Ledger? new to crypto.

What do you think about adopting BCH more than BTC ?
I just realised is an illusion.
You can’t totally exclude a part of society like companies, politics and banks from  money in a bliss of an eye.
Changing take quite relatively its own time.
Adopting now BCH in terms of payment and p2p electronic cash would be a nightmare.
A war against central banks instead of a slow transition (but steady) like bitcoin is doing.
It’s obvious that majority of people don’t get what an hardware wallet is or DeFi.
This is where institutions and banks are still taking profits, but with times BTC is doing a transition of power from centralised institutions towards individuals.
And this is all great and blissful.

I think that BCH will continue growing reflecting the power of his father-mother BTC in the future.

I am really sorry if this is a dumb question. So let's say BTC, from what I understand the max amount of BTC is 21 million, and currently 18.7 million have been mined. And I've also learned that the BTC you get from mining each block will be halved over and over again.

SergeyKalinin,"1. Completely buggy image verification system. I sent I sent my passport in vain thirty times literally (it only to find out that instead of national - that is, my civil passport (is written on the website clearly: ""please attach the national identification document"") , it turns out that a foreign passport is required (!!) and this is indicated by support in a letter a week later! ...

In general, I wonder why require a foreign passport ... I'm not obliged to have one as a citizen of the Russian Federation. Is this something that should somehow hinder the crypto operations via Simplex? Okay, so be it, a week later I started loading my foreign passport ...

&amp;#x200B;

2. Every time I attach documents, the system writes that photos are blurry, glare detected - I actually tried to attach it 30 times, I took pictures from the 8th iPhone, from Samsung, from different angles, under different light conditions, I even asked another person to take a picture of these documents instead of me (I thought it was from maybe my hands are crooked), the result is the same - blurry! ... idiocy, the system simply does not accept documents and that's it. This identification is not really well tested and instead of simplifying the verification of documents, it's just torturing people who want to register !! Passports always contain glowing security features, and they will always be blurry and make glares!

&amp;#x200B;

3. By some miracle, after completing the ""attach pictures"" exercise, from the attempt number 31, having lost faith in humanity, and also receiving robotic replies in Simplex chat - I proceeded to the window, which stated that photos I have uploaded are on ""manual verification""... This window just hung for another week without any changes. After this week of ""manual verification"" I was simply asked to try again uploading pictures to the buggy system ... Dear Simplex, where is logic?  I even mailed them already by that moment all required documents in high quality - all the same, they send only formal replies and asking you to perform clearly according to the algorithm, like robots ... In a response to my letter, they just repeated me a link, to upload all photos to this moronic system as if I have just registered.

So what do you think? I opened that link and saw a window which stated that ""manual verification"" is being carried out and there were no forms for uploading a photo ... Then there were 2 more iterations of useless correspondence with robots and their formal replies in chat and by mail, in style ""we will fix it now"", ""everything will be ok"" ... and another week of my time has gone...

&amp;#x200B;

4. After some time I again managed to upload all the documents and froze for another week on ""manual verification"". Deja vu... I wrote to them about all this in their chat, they promised to speed it up. As a result, thank you, they ""speeded it up"" ... Another week has passed and I receive a new request:

1. Certificate of criminal record (it takes up to 30 days to receive this paper from the police!)

2. Extract from all bank accounts, where I spent how much and how muck i have earned for 3 months (is this really necessary to open a simple banking account??? What will Simplex do with all my McDonnalds spending checks?)

3. Am I a politically engaged person? (Oh Really? They haven't googled that I am the former president of Russian Federation after a month of registration??)

&amp;#x200B;

Okay, In total, it has already been already 5 weeks since I started my registration in Simplex ... In fact, the account has not yet been opened, I continue sending and sending all new documents ... My requests, to somehow speed up this process, are replied with formal robotic answers that are in fact don't help much.

By today, I have sent an the statement from Sberbank with all my income and spendings for 3 months. Now I am waiting for the readiness of a certificate of no criminal record from the police (I have never ever been asked such document in my life, Simplex is the first company that asked me this shit).

&amp;#x200B;

If you want to lose a month of your life, chat with robots and achieve nothing, then apply for registration in Simplex. I wouldn't recommend Simplex to anyone, it's a terrible service. It would be easier to open an account in the most ordinary bank!

&amp;#x200B;

PS. I will by all means get them to open an account. I need it, because without it, you cannot issue a COTI debit card. Up to now it is 1 month that has passed in vain. I will write on how things are developing!

diwalost,"For those who don't have time to read the complete article, here is the TLDR

Here’s the basic premise. In partnership with data firm The TIE, Cointelegraph Markets Pro has developed the VORTECS Score, ""an algorithmic determination of how bullish or bearish current trading conditions are for a given crypto asset.""

The score is based on historical data, and it considers whole history of a coin or token looking for conditions like trading volume, recent price action, social sentiment, and even the volume of tweets about that asset, that are similar to those it observes right now.

If it finds similarities, it looks at what happened next. Did the asset go up or down? How consistent was that movement? How significant was the rise or fall?

1. Combining all of these data points, it creates the VORTECS™ Score,  
2. The higher the score, the more bullish the outlook — and the more confident the algorithm is and vice versa.
3. A neutral score of 50 means the algorithm sees no significant correlation between current conditions and past price performance.
4. A Buy 80, Sell 12 hours strategy means that the test ‘buys’ every asset that crosses the 80 score, which is considered strongly bullish. And then it ‘sells’ the asset again after precisely 12 hours.
5. Of course, this is not happening on an exchange — it’s happening on a spreadsheet because it is just a test of concept. 

Why you couldn’t do this

1. It takes someone two manage the portfolio 24*7 even without sleep.
2.  It doesn't take into account liquidity or order depth on any particular asset on any given exchange. 
3. exchange fees involved.

So why is this a valuable test at all?

A high VORTECS Score has a proven correlation to price appreciation. Not in every instance, not for every asset… but in general this ten-month trial has made a compelling case.",0,TLDR - What is VORTECS experiment and score?

In this state sub is more quantity over quality but it keeps us interacted in some way and so called shitposting let people earn moons.

I agree there is a lot or rather too much copied content and it bothers me.  I would prefer more calm sub with a healty ratio of quality and comedy posts!

I don't know if possible but if this sub could be divided by tabs, one of the tabs would be designated for shitposts/comedy posts and another tab for helpful posts/guides etc. that would greatly help divide those two things in sub while keeping everything in the same sub with possibility to earn moons either for shitposts or quality posts!
This way we could achieve what people of this sub want, be able to avoid low quality/comedy content and only see content they want to see. 


This might be a hot take but I actually think moons improve this sub aside some downsides that come along! We could say we are still early with moons and for me community has to play role in shaping this sub! We need to speak up, and help keep this sub in best shape possible!

amandamichelle90,"We all do it, our entry price or the price we spent the majority of our time holding it at, or the ATH we put mental emphasis on certain prices and to us it becomes “on sale” or “overpriced” just because we saw it higher or lower for a long time and got attached. 

Times like this we hear “don’t buy at all time high” which, by the way is only a thing until it goes higher and only really matters if you’re looking for a quick flip — kinda irrelevant to the long term idea. 

But as time goes on, you lose those emotional evaluations of the standard price, a little over a year ago we saw BTC hit 10k for the very last time and there were absolutely people who discouraged buying in at that price — today though you would be happy you did. *There’s also people who sell at times like these, hoping to buy back in on the dip and end up holding more coins, we don’t speak of it as frequently but it’s the same feeling as selling for a loss because people do often eventually buy back in at a higher price than they wanted to.*

Zantti,"Is hype really the crucial thing in cryptocurrencies?

As stated above I truly believe that hype is important in this space but sometimes I get the impression that it is also the only thing that matters in all of this.

We’re all witnessing some great projects not being listed on exchanges while some “shit” projects are being listed.

Why?

They have no purpose, they don't have any project behind them, but they have something that some great projects don't have and that's hype.

Let’s be honest, many people finish ""DYOR"" within minutes. They google ""price prediction"" and are happy with the number they see, and since they can buy millions of coins for $50, they feel they will make a huge profit. They don’t understand tokenomics, they don’t understand market capital. In the long term they may fail, but in the short term it happens that they sometimes succeed.

I sincerely want everyone to make gains but I can’t hide that the success of some coins that serve no purpose frustrates me while some good projects with awesome hardworking team behind them fail.

Why does this matter? Because new people who enter this world do not understand a lot of things. They lose money and cryptocurrencies are in their heads ""a scam"".

I have changed the way I do it a few times now but most recently I DCA $10 aud a day into ETH and BTC. I take $20 aud a week from my pay and the rest I make up from selling stuff I don't need or use any more like my PS4 for instance. I put the money into a normal bank account and then just transfer say $50 dollars into my crypto exchange and then DCA $10 a day from that. It's not heaps of money but It all adds up.

Blooberino,"I have a process for my DCA. Purists would DCA blindly: I have my fiat for my weekly buy, so smash that buy button and walk away. 

But I DCA a little differently, and for 3 consecutive weeks, I've sabotaged myself with greed. 

**Here's how I do it.**

So today I was to buy ETH. Saturday is my day for ETH. And when I woke up, the price was somewhere around $3,975. I figure it's reasonable with price fluctuations throughout the day to set a limit buy for $3,950. But then the prices went up. Over 4k it goes and I adjust my limit to $4,000. 

But the price kept going up. $4,050, $4,100, and now nearly $4,150. If I just bought at whatever price this morning, I'd be up 4% already. But now I'm still holding my money because I don't want to buy high. 

Granted, I could've bought at the random non-round number, but the psychology of it wants me to get juuuuuust a little bit better of a price. 

So now I have a $4,000 buy order, and it will likely fill during a big fat dip as the knife falls.

Xidorian,"Okay so I have immersed myself into crypto, learned a ton, do my own research, take proper security precautions, etc. But now what?

- How do I bring money over from my bank and buy crypto relatively safely while not utilizing CEXs and having to fill out KYCs?
- Are ecosystems like Cosmos, Polkadot, Cardano etc. more similar to tcp than browsers? 
   - if so, why can you view them on the internet and not have to use a specific application? Basically how does it all connect together and how do I ""use"" Atom or Polkadot for example?
- also how tf is monero not traceable? Can't they just see what was on your account and do the math? 
- if coins are built on specific blockchains, why aren't wallets and exchanges and dexs more transparent about what chains the coin you hold are on!?!

Geddy87,"I have been debating on taking some profits out recently , the FOMO was pretty hard to get by and I held off for a long while ; which netted me a bit higher gains, but eventually the trigger has to be pulled and you can drive yourself mad if you wonder about the what if etc . 

I needed to fix my vehicle and I wanted to fix a broken tooth, I think these were both solid investments and at the end of the day I invested in order to be able to better my future and be able to pay for things like this. 

I got rid of about 40% of my portfolio so I still have a decent amount to hold in there ; probably what’s keeping me from really over thinking this decision.

mattgangloff,"Yeah, we're very near ATH.

But last night, I finally setup my Coinbase account to automatically DCA into Bitcoin weekly. And I'm confident it's the right move.

Last year, I invested a small amount into the top handful of projects. But then I swore not to invest any more until I understood what I was investing in. I try to adhere to that rule so I never get caught too bad by FOMO.

I took a few online courses, read and listened to everything I could get my hands on. I finally felt ready to start increasing my position (over 5% of liquid assets) and it just so happens we're at ATH. 

I thought maybe I should wait for a dip. But, I pulled the trigger anyway.

Jq4000,"The two things that people get wrong when measuring inflation:

1. They think it's linear
2. They measure with the wrong things

People are claiming CPI is a terrible measure of inflation for a few reasons:

1. You're measuring plentiful goods
2. You're measuring what it means to subsist rather than get ahead in life

The true measure of inflation is how much assets have increased in price. Assets are what people should strive for and what QE keeps pushing farther and farther out of reach of those who don't have any.

Since we fired up the money printers in April 2020, both real estate and the stock market have gone up \~27%. Which very closely mirrors the increase in the money supply. That is the true cost of inflation.

If you're saving up for a down payment on a house you needed a 27% raise this year to stay on track, not a 5.6% raise.

Nuewim,"Market cap is one of most important stats for crypto investors. By knowing current market cap we know how big our profits can be.  By calculating our dream price x number of all coins we can check if market cap will made our dreams ever possible to achieve. 

But there is one problem. It is just numbers. Reality often prove math doesn't work so well as it should. People and markets are unpredictable. 10 years ago Bitcoin having 1 trillion market cap was crazy idea. You would probably end in mental hospital for saying it. In XVI century no would have idea some tulips will be worth as much as a houses. In 2019 no one sane predicted doge can grow so much as it did. Human history if full of impossible things.


Not all existing  coins will possible to  sell. Actually bilions of $  in crypto  were lost forever. For example 21 millions  BTC is just base number. Already thousands of wallets were lost with combined tens or maybe hundreds of thousands of BTC. Satoshi Nakamoto alone have like 1 million BTC. His wallet is inactive for years, we don't even know if he is alive. A lot of other  coins are on lost wallets or destroyed hard discs, owners died etc. Access to them is lost, no one will ever sell them. 

And also a lot of projects burn coins to increase price and reduce number of coins. Market cap is not good measure for coins that have burns. And there are quite a few coins like that, and unlike most people say not only shitcoins burn coins. Best to examples are Ethereum and  BNB also Shiba. Calculating current number of coins with future price or market cap doesn't work for them.

So yes market cap is very important, especially for beginners that dream about impossible things, but after all it is just another stat that can change to certain level especially in long period of time.",0,"Market cap is very important, but not most important. There is usually less coins that we predict and some coins also have burns."

silverfire626,"I’ve only gotten into crypto since the beginning of the year but this community has helped me out a lot.

I got greedy in March thinking I was a genius, put everything I could in April to only have it crash.

I was afraid in may and June but didn’t sell. I was trying to round up fiat but even then, I was always wondering if it would go lower.

The fact is none of us can time the market. If you could then you would leverage trade. However, you should always be in a position to come out ahead no matter what it does.

For instance, I wanted to get into matic and thought 1.22 was too high and wanted it to get down some more. I said screw I’ll put in a little bit (now it’s at 1.60).

I bought Vet when it was a 22c and then it crashed to 7c. I decided to put more in and now it’s climbing up to 14c+

So long as you don’t need the money immediately, red days will help with long term wealth accumulation. It’s much easier to 10-20x when you are buying a crypto at a 50% discount than at an ATH.

Kilv3r,"If you were born like me in the last millennium, chances are that you, or someone you know, collected postage stamps.

This was one of the first collectibles I engaged with, long before Magic: The Gathering. I remember the excitement of waiting for the stamps to come off the water-soaked envelopes.

At that time, I was far from being the only one involved in stamp collectibles. Nowadays, this lost some mainstream attractivity.

But that might change thanks to the global adoption of NFTs.

 The Swiss national post launches Switzerland’s first crypto stamps.
The Swiss national post recently announced that they would launch the first Swiss Crypto stamp (on November 25, 2021). This new of a kind stamp will be composed of a physical and a digital part. The physical stamp will cost 8.90 CHF (approx. 9.71 USD on October 2021) and have a digital crypto image associated with it. 

After purchasing a stamp, people will be able to scan a QR code to reveal the digital counterpart. The digital crypto stamps will have different rarity levels, as it is common in the NFT space.

Swiss crypto stamps facts:

- 13 different designs
- Each NFT is stored on the Polygon Blockchain
- 65,000 copies of the most common digital design and 50 of the rarest
- 175,000 stamps available at launch

This collection of digital stamps shall relaunch the excitement for collecting, exchanging, and trading stamps. Only that this time, people will exchange their stamps on NFT platforms such as OpenSea.

Note that the Swiss crypto stamps are not the first ones to be produced. The neighboring country Austria previously released the very first crypto stamps in 2019.

 Why am I so bullish about this announcement.
Launching these crypto stamps means that a broad audience will have direct exposure to the NFT world. Imagine that now people will be able to buy NFTs from their local post office!

Soon, people will want to know more about NFTs and the cryptocurrency world in general. 

This is a step towards better education and mass adoption of cryptos, and the reason I am so bullish about this news.

nerdy_1234,"(I am NOT a crypto guy, I have a background in business analytics but no jack shit about most things crypto and I steer clear of it unless I see major finance institutions moving cash with it) 

My main issues are:

1. The so called Anti-Whale mechanic isn't described except the burn 2% distributed 2% to holders, if a set limit to sales exists, its not listed in their white paper or any other part of their site.
2. I don't see a single unique technical thing that this coin has going for it, even the name isn't ""MEME"" enough to make people direct buy into it 
3. The kinds of platforms and wallets they are talking about building with SaitamaMask take a very specific team skill set that I don't see in their founders (I see the sales, business, and a bit of tech but not web dev or a CTO that I have faith in)
4.  Offering the option to buy NFT's as well on their platform seems like an afterthought and not a well built plan

Most projects spend more on their PR, website and social media than on their tech...

To save you from FOMO-ing into every new revolutionary coin, I suggest the following strategy:

**Every project is a scam (or a dead end) until proven legit.**

What it means is you should start looking into any project as if it is a scam OR as if it's dead in the water. Keep this in mind as long as you DYOR. Turn the tables – *they* have to tick all your boxes to convince you. 

By the time you start researching a project, the team has already revealed all they wanted to reveal on their website, in whitepaper, medium articles and such. If some information is not clear or missing – assume it's intentional.

Question everything. Instead of looking for red flags, assume there are only red flags unless proven otherwise.",0,"""Every project is a scam or dead end until proven otherwise."" – DYOR strategy that will save you some cash"

DaddySkates,"I trust in the technology. I am astonished by what it offers. I look forward to where it will take us. But the real reason that I started to invest into crypto isn't anything like that.

I simply want to be able to enjoy life instead of working my ass off just to be left with few tenners at the end of month and my kids bugging me to go to a trip somewhere. It's depressing because I try hard and still cant see myself truly enjoying life regardless of how much hours I put in.

martinlasek,"There's a creator on twitter who doesn't care about NFTs. However someone just took his art, created an account in opensea, chose his name as a username and ""minted"" his art as NFTs to then sell them there.

Now other people knowing this creator tweeted him asking if it's really him. Just to make sure when they buy his art that it's legit. It wasn't and the original creator was upset about how easy it is to ""steal"" and make money off of his art that way.

This made me think. What if you just create some random 3D art in your basement at 2 o'clock in the morning under the influence of a good energy drink and great melodic dubstep and mint it and put it on opensea. Then 5 days later someone else just takes your png and mints it and puts it on SolSea.

Amelie007,"The answer is never. When it comes to matters of price it is important to keep a little perspective, and one of the best tools for doing that is to compare the marketcap of one coin to another. 

The crazy but more proper question would be like this: ""What would be the price of SafeMoon if it had the marketcap of Bitcoin"".

https://preview.redd.it/ttkr436v79v71.png?width=774&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7337142e4ac41ae53a879190bb46033a588e8495

So as you can see, even if SafeMoon somehow managed to achieve a marketcap valuation of $1.16 Trillion dollars, SafeMoon would still not even get close to $1 in price. When you look at the circulating supply of Bitcoin being close to 19 million and understand that the circulating supply of SafeMoon is 574 Trillion, that should also tell you why a $1 SafeMoon is an impossibility, as it would have to reach a marketcap that not even all the countries in the world combined have.

**You can go to** [**https://www.marketcapof.com/**](https://www.marketcapof.com/) **and start comparing the marketcap of one coin to another to get a better perspective.**

Also, to acknowledge in the best way I can just how immensely powerful Moons have been in shaping my own life in the past 12+ months and how I perceive the future. I can't wait to get back to classroom or in person teaching and use Moons as the perfect educational tool for my students and clients.

I'm pretty new to the NFT game and very much learning the ropes with Art, Photography etc. with a view to honing the craft and releasing an NFT collection in future which will also form an integral part of a turn-based blockchain game.

I'd appreciate any feedback regarding this or indeed any of my other NFTs in my collections, especially concerning how they are displayed, and whether the markdown meta data for exclusive content displays as it should.

NFTs are a super exciting emerging market that will eventually become ubiquitous throughout society for birth/land registry, certifications, authenticity declarations etc.

I highly recommend anyone takes a wee bit of time to learn how to mint the most basic NFT as it's a skill that will automatically put you ahead of the curve in pretty much any future industry.

Nervous_Sky_5167,"TL;DR: A rant about banks and how ridiculously corrupt financial services are today.   


In the early 2008s, a bunch of wealthy banks decided it was a good idea to sell unbacked, sub-prime mortgages. This was the practice of giving mortgages to individuals that had so bad credit scores/ low income, it was nearly impossible for them to pay it back. To compensate for this 'risk', these *subprime* *mortgages* charged higher interest rates, which were FAR more profitable than the *prime mortgages* they were used to selling. As more and more banks piled on this train and the subprime bubble grew, it only would take a few defaults to set off an explosion. And that it did.

After the US banks bailed out these banks, Goldman Sachs, JP Morgan Chase, Citigroup, just to name a few, were fined **fractions** of their profits. Only 54.4 billion dollars were fined from the largest banks involved, their crimes which had cost the global economy **30 trillion dollars of wealth**. Over 9 million Americans alone lost their jobs, or 6 % of the total workforce, but that wasn't even the worst of it. 

After these banks screwed up subprime mortgages, they used the bail-out money to robot foreclose MOST mortgages, which ended up in one of the worst real-estate dumps, and as a result, 13 trillion dollars worth of homeowner net worth was wiped clean. Robo-foreclosure is the extremely lazy, indiscriminate practice of EVICTING a homeowner and then LIQUIDATING their home to cover the bank's portion of the mortgage, without even considering the mortgage's quality or status. 

**And the crazy part of this all? NOBODY, NOT A SINGLE BANKER WENT TO JAIL FOR THIS.** 

All the youngster's still reading, you think this was bad? Research fractional reserve banking, the practice where banks routinely credit lend your deposited money for interest farming and then pay you a small surplus of what they earn. That's how banks earn most of their money, through lending. And oh my god, does it reak havoc. 

When your deposit of 100$ is blended to another bank at an interest rate, the credit present in the world nearly doubles. Banks are required to secure at least 10% of the original deposit, but the other 90% are lent out, creating 100$ of ghost money in your account, and another 90$ of real money in a loan borrower's account. And this happens successfully, 90$ gets loaned into 81$, and that gets loaned into 73$... Suddenly, an additional 144$ was created out of thin air from your deposit! 

Now when you withdraw your 100$, in a linear world, the 144$ of loan ghost money is suddenly wiped. Now think what would happen if more than just a few people took out their money. Does anyone here still remember the Greece Euro financial crisis? Everyone withdrew their money until all that was left was ghost money. BILLIONS of the inflated economy LOST in seconds. 

And here's just a list of atrocities banks have:

\- The fact that, by policy, your deposited money is not owned by you, but becomes the property of the bank, and that you have ZERO right to that money. 

\- The fact that over 35% of the US dollar's entire existence was printed from February 2020 to 2021. Don't believe me? Look below:

&amp;#x200B;

\- The fact that just like any other 'speculative asset', does the US dollar also have restricted liquidity. You probably wondering, if 35% inflation is backed up in a single year, why isn't everything on fire? Due to low distribution since the Pandemic has lowered spending, money doesn't exchange hands fast enough as of right now to fully distribute 35% inflation.

Hi, i tried getting into margin trading for the first time, just trying to clarify a thing or two.

Could someone please tell me exactly how are the fees/interest calculated on binance? I found this formula on their site: I (interest) = P (borrowed money) \* R (daily interest 0.02%/24) \* T (in hours) , and i saw somewhere that they charge 0,1% (or whatever amount) of the borrowed amount per hour. Does it mean that you're paying both the hourly fees on the amount you borrowed plus the daily interest?

For exemple, with a 1000€ collateral and a X5 leverage in a long, would it mean that i couldn't let it run for too many days, orelse i'd have to pay some stupidly high fees? 

If that is the case, could you recommand any other exchange that would be more advantageous, if there is any? Thanks.",0,How does binance margin trading really work?

Why is this... Our first governance period ends... Dec 31st 2021...

But you have to commit algos for the next period b4 the new one q1 starts in Jan 1st 2022...

Our rewards will not be given b4 the new commitment period starts.

What do we do in order to maximize our compounding interest...

Here's what I am doing...

I am adding more Algo to my wallet before the end of this year... I will double my holdings(plus max 32%, which is the max reward given)...

By doing this I will be able to take advantage of all the potential compounding interest possibilities.

By doing this I will be ahead of everyone else, that does not do this...

And in compounding, the sooner you start, the greater the return...

So if I cover the max reward myself... I compound an additional 32% in q1 of next year, while others will have to wait till q2 to compound their rewards from the first Gov period.

Let's say you start q4 2021 with 100 algo.

Q4 100 reward 20%  = 120
Q1 100 algo reward 20% = 120
Q2 120 algo reward 20% = total 144 algo plus 20(q4)=164
Q3 164 algo reward 20% = 196.8 algo.


But if you add the reward yourself... You can compound right away...

Q4 100algo at 20% = 120
Q1 120 algo at 20% = 144 
Q2 144 algo ( plus the 20% earned q4 = 20) equals 164algos committed) at 20% = 196.8 algo...

By doing what I'm doing I'll double my algo in 3 quarters instead of 4.

This is not financial advice... Just my future stupid strategy... Do not do as I do or say.",0,Attention all Governors
OldEntertainment9570,"Hey all, something came to my mind recently and i decided to create a hypothetical but kind of probable scenario and open it for discussion.

What happens if the western nations decided to implement some authoritarian measures and confiscate private possessions in order to control the spread of crypto ?

Or if global central banks decided to simultaneously purchase the majority of Cryptocurrencies through obtaining over 70% of the worlds bitcoin in circulation? ( Yes they can do that because they control the money printing machines !)

In my own humble opinion the war on crypto is something that can escalate depending on if the goverments start losing control of their only source of power which is FIAT.

I will continue to HODL and DCA even if shit goes south , because shifting the power back to Gold through a re implementation of the Gold standard is out of sight for the near future .",0,Can crypto be rugpulled?

&amp;#x200B;

Since I got into crypto, I've been looking for ways to take advantage of the massive volatility in the market, however every time I've tried to trade on my own I get crushed.  I spent some time looking into algorithmic trading that the big fish do and everything I found was a proprietary paid service.  I'm not much of a coder so writing my own code and integrating an API wasn't a good option for me either.

&amp;#x200B;

Superalgos is a project I found that is so under the radar it honestly took me a while to find it, even when it was exactly what I was looking for.  It's everything I could have dreamed of.

&amp;#x200B;

Seriously guys, this thing has an amazing graphic interface and tutorials that detail how to build or use bots.  The team behind it has been working on it for four years now and are at the point where they've integrated machine learning and AI.  

&amp;#x200B;

I'm not here to shill, it's not a paid service and I'm not a contributor.  I searched this sub and found almost nothing about it, and it deserves more attention.  The entire premise behind it is that the algos evolve within the ecosystem as the community grows and more people contribute.

Centralized storage in simple words is saving all the data that someone has in one place, for example Facebook or any other platform saves all of Its users data in its private servers. Therefore a hacker could focus on Facebook and try to breach it (as it always have already happened) since it's a single point of failure.

After these NFTs entered the open market, they were priced at 5 ETH/each. That's how crazy it was. 0.2 to mint, resold at 5ETH. The people that won the chance to buy one, basically won lottery tickets.

Many people, me included, were incredibly disappointed we didn't even get the chance to buy. But here's the scary part. Many tried to buy from the openmarket at 5 ETH because the FOMO was getting wild.

Many people that bought them at 5 ETH lost a lot of money because now they are being resold for 1.5 ETH. 

1) bought at minting price, I would have made some nice 5 figure profits.

2) If I bought after they entered the open market at peak FOMO, I would have lost 5 figures.

TrafficConeWriter,"I was running some numbers out of interest to see what regression models would say about some cryptos I am into. I figured I would share.

A quick statistics background, a regression model is calculated based on the historical data. I pulled 5 years of the crypto's daily high price (note: not all cryptos have 5 years of data). The R-squared value is an evaluation of how accurate the model is. In statistics terms, the R-squared value is defined as ""the amount of variation in the historical data accounted for by the model equation."" In other words, the closer to 1 the R-squared value is, the more accurate the model's projects will be.

As a general reference, typically in projection models, anything about 0.65 is considered pretty good at projecting the future, and anything about 0.90 is considered very reliable.

Here is the summary of the projections for 1 year from today:

&amp;#x200B;

[1 year projections](https://preview.redd.it/6050czcbf8v71.png?width=588&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=376044eb9724eb09c7e882d7ddfd725c1d5e278d)

Based on the data, Solana will have a 744% increase over the next year. The R-squared for this model is 0.8715, which is actually pretty high. However, to assume the value will actually jump 744% would probably be pretty insane based on logic and reason, nevertheless, this model seems very promising.

BTC has a 97% projected increase, and this number I take more significantly. Also take note of the two columns to the far right. The % low means the model is confident in the value being above 62%, but it means it is not very likely the increase will be above 140%.

You can take a look at some of the rest of the values, but most of them seem promising.

BTC, ETH, ADA, SOL, and ALGO are the coins I was really interested in, DOGE I added because, well I don't know I figured people would want to know.

BTC, ETH, ADA, and SOL all had R-squared values above 0.8, so to me I would have some faith in these models. 

Another important thing to note would be that the more data there is, the more accurate the model will be. BTC, ETH, DOGE all actually had 5 years of data, ADA had about 4 years, and SOL and ALGO had around 2 years.

I'll post the actual trends with their trendlines and their equations below. In each case, the top equation is the polynomial value and the bottom value is the linear equation. I never actually did any calculations based on the linear equations because linear equations wouldn't really be a good projection of crypto trends.

On a final note, the disclaimers. This is not financial advice, do your own research, and statistical projections are always going to be risky for financials. I personally will probably use these projects, but in no way to I expect something like 700% increase in any SOL investments.

Lately several central banks in Europe have implemented a negative interest rate policy aka NIRP on excess bank reserves in the financial system. Japan is the next country that will be affected with the NIRP. 

For a country where there are 7 national banks operating and many, many other megabanks and postal banks, residents are estimated to have as much as 8-10 accounts per adult on average. This is mega ultra bullish. Not resident but adult, keep that in mind. 

I used to live in Japan in my youth and people store insane amount of money across several different banks in order to get those sweet returns. And crypto is far from popular there. US and EU is years ahead in terms of adoption compared to Japan where its still almost unheard of to be holding crypto. People think Japan is super ahead of others when it comes to tech but its quite the opposite. Fax machines are still the king of sending the documentation and important data in banks. 

According to the data from Bank Of Japan, there are approximately 920,000,000 reported bank accounts in Japan. Given that there are about 125 million people in Japan and about 13% are children this brings you to about 10 accounts per adult on average. 


According to the latest [Statista report](https://www.statista.com/topics/7629/banking-industry-in-japan/#topicHeader__wrapper) the banks assets in Japan are worth above 18.5 trillion dollars. Coinbase knows that and thats exactly why they decided to go in Japan now. They see this opportunity of a lifetime.

HulkingBrain,"I find that a complicating factor when investing in crypto is that the space is so young, that potential returns are enormous once you start pushing the goal posts back a few years, or a decade, or two decades. Any exit strategy that I come up with seems premature.  What’s a 300% win if a 1000% win might require just a little more patience?  When should I sell an asset that keeps rising in value, year by year?

This is where I think it’s useful to become a bit more existential and death-oriented (the other great exit) in my thinking.  There’s a useful exercise that some therapists employ, where you draw a line on a piece of paper about 10 inches long.  Imagine this line is how long you’re going to live. The beginning of the line is your birth, and the end of the line is your death.  Now, mark on that line where you think you might be.  How much life do you have left?   How much time?  

Now start to imagine what you want to accomplish with what’s left of your time line.  House and kids?  Do you want to start your own business?  Write an publish a book? Record a music album?  Leave your loved ones financial security?  Study vipassana meditation like a monk for a few years?  What’s the thing that you would do that would endow your life with meaning, that you would be proud of when you’re reflecting backwards on your death bed?

Whatever project that will give your life meaning will no doubt come with costs on your time, your energy and your material wealth.  It’s the last of these costs that, in my opinion, are the ultimate consideration when considering an ‘exit strategy’ in crypto.

FunContest8489,"Ok so I keep seeing posts about things for crypto beginners to know, etc. I’m a casual investor, i.e. I don’t have thousands to put in, don’t do a ton of research, and there’s a whole hell of a lot I don’t know about crypto, blockchain, etc. But I’ve been pretty successful with it (~ +800% return overall). So here are my rules for casual investors who don’t want to spend all their free time researching/checking charts and don’t have $10k to YOLO into projects they like. 

1. HODL. One of the things I learned really quickly is that chasing short term gains, by chasing market volatility, can make you money. However, it’s a lot of work, hard to get right (read: risky), and really requires an understanding of markets, graphs/charts, trend patterns, etc. As a casual, it’s much easier, and likely more profitable, to buy things that are likely to grow and just hold them. 

2.  Don’t panic! The crypto market is super volatile. Which means that things can change in the space of a minute. It also means that things can change back just as quickly. If something goes down, just wait. Unless you bought into something sketchy (see rule 3), it’ll probably go back up eventually. 

3. Buy from reputable exchanges (except Robinhood, fuck Robinhood). If a coin is tradeable on Coinbase, Voyager, etc. it’s probably not going to FULLY collapse. Obviously there are exceptions to this statement (don’t @ me), but it’s a much better bet than some random shit coin you heard about on telegram and traded into on a DEX. 

4. DCA is your friend. If you can, DCA is a great way to mitigate risk. This doesn’t need any more explanation I don’t think…

5. Avoid FOMO. If a coin is spiking, you’re probably too late. There will always be another meme coin/pump and dump you can take advantage of. Don’t worry if you missed this one. If you FOMO in at ATH and it only goes up another 5%, you aren’t going to take profits because you’re chasing the big win. You’re going to lose value and be stuck waiting for another pump. 

6. Diversify. Don’t just pick one. Put a little bit into several coins. Most successful strategies I’ve seen have relied on spreading investment around to take advantage of multiple things rising. And, if something goes down, you aren’t losing as much. 

That’s it. If anyone has additions or changes they think would be good I’d love to hear them.",0,Rules for casuals

JustAnuthaLooser,"Preface: I'm super new to crypto, I have absolutely no clue what I'm doing.

So, I'm possibly expecting to receive some form of NFT in the future, and was looking at cold hardware wallets to store them securely. Offline.

I stumbled upon 2 brands that really stick out for me:

Ledger and Trezor (Keepkey also seemed interesting, but I'm worried it isn't as safe).

Anyways,

There's issues with them that are making it difficult to decide which one to get.

Mainly:

Ledger: data leak and tiny screen.
Trezor: can be brute forced.


Anyway, these are some of the main differences I've noticed simply by reading reviews..

Pros:

Ledger: sleek, cheaper, dual-chip.
Trezor: open-source, larger screen, shamir backup.

Things that give me pause:

Ledger: S can only hold 3-4apps?(what does that mean and does it matter to me? I think the NFT will be on Eth).

Trezor: Pricier..  budget is at the moment a concern for me. But if one is definitely safer than the rest, I'll pay up.

Thanks for any help, sorry I'm a complete noob at this stuff, I'm just catching up to crypto/NFT...

jgarcya,"I'm poor... An artist, was homeless( couch surfing, but employed).... Had little money to invest due to too much debt....

But that was the past..... Except being poor.

I managed to elimininate a major bill, over 14yrs of paying it....

Here's why I'm rarely in the red.

I was gifted my first $100 in btc in 2018 @ btc= 10,000.... I also used faucets to gather btc, eth, ltc, and bch.

I was lucky to find Bob loukas and his 4 yr cycle of btc, in early 2019.....

Then I was lucky enough to find coinflip ATM... Where I could buy btc,ltc, and eth.

So in March 2019, the start of the 4 yr cycle.... I started taking every extra bit of money, after my bills, and put it in ATM... I was buying pieces of btc for 3800, ltc for less than $40, and eth for under $200...

This was just $20- $100 at a time... No more than $200/mo....

2019 btc ran up really fast.... I wasn't able to keep up.. I had a goal of owning 1btc.... Never happened.

But then, as time went buy, I started buying more and more btc.... When it dipped 10% I went and put $100 on it.... Every dip I could buy I bought.

The crash of March 2020... Btc went from 10k- 3800... I bought every dip... But only small portions...

Then came the run up of 2020...10k- 30k very quickly... I stopped buying btc at $11,500...

In May of 2020, I finally decided to buy some doge...
I found an ATM to get some 3.5 hrs away... Paid an 16% fee, but bought $140 worth at .003... Doge was my long shot.

Still acquired more ltc..... But stopped buying eth( stupid)....

2021 still bought more doge, and bought more eth at $1800...after we saw highs of 3-4k... I bought the dip!.

So here it is current 2021... My last purchase was ALGO... Just to lock it up in governance at 5.7- 32%.

Knowing the 4 yr cycle... I refused to buy btc in 2021, knowing it will retrace 70-80 % in 2022...

I couldn't justify.... Bringing my average up... I average btc at less than 8k...

All of my holdings are in massive gains 300% - 8000%... Except algo( but this is a different play.. Passive income).

So I got to ride out all of 2020 after March in the plus... All of 2021 in the plus...

All of 2022 will be in the plus( even though it will be a down year).... Bc I didn't chase ATH...

In 2023... At the next 4 yr cycle.... I will take saved up fiat, and buy more btc/eth/ltc.... And doge if it drops below .10...

I sleep great at night knowing... I don't have to worry about dips of 30% or 50%... 

I know most here think DCA is the best strategy... Just set a time buy a set amount every 2 wks or month.... And yes it works...

But for me.... I only buy depending on where we are in the 4 yr cycle.... I don't buy the bull run(except wth at 50% off)..... 

I won't buy in the bear of 2022.... I won't try to catch a falling knife.... I'll wait till it hits the ground, then pick it up in 2023...

People say you can't time the market.... That's not necessary... Just know the cycles, and buy the dips... The bigger the dip the better.

I have turned a couple k into 5 digits... And possibly 6 at the end of the bull run....

Never in the red again.

Hope this helps others... Patience and knowing the 4 yr cycle is key...",0,This is why I'm rarely in the red
demo39,"So I decided to start investing into the crypto world. Very new to it and new to
Investing. We all have to start somewhere right?. It took me months before I bought my first stock. Yes I only have one stock(I’m edumacating my self) I had an investor but wasn’t making any big returns, I have your typical TFSA and RRSP. She told me stocks are the old way of investing so me being new I’m listening to her. Then I started to do my own research and realized with the stocks your returns “could” be very beneficial. So I started reading books, material online and YouTube and the occasional Reddit post. After talking to a friend and the returns he’s been getting investing in crypto is very appealing. So I’ve been doing my research and like what I see. But also have been seeing negative comments and articles saying stay away from crypto very volatile and could lose your life savings. Well to me same goes for stocks. So I continue on with my research and doing my DD and found that one trading platform offers visas and your earnings could be transferred to the visa. Nice I like that!! I sign up and start seeing hype about Shiba and other ones and start researching online the various coins. Now I’m very interested but keep seeing a lot of posts and articles to stay away!. I believe crypto is here to stay and yes very volatile but some good returns. If your not a professional stay away!! But I don’t want to I want to learn more about this and go for those nice gains. That being said how many and be honest, can say they are new to investing and are self taught and can learn from YouTube videos and even Reddit and made it work in the crypto world. I’ve read don’t day and swing trade crypto, buy and hold. But see lots are successful at day and swing trading. All the positive and negative make it harder to decide if one keeps going.

jotaCryp,"Do you know why? Because the Internet has not been that positive change either. And the Internet is a much bigger deal than crypto and blockchain.

In the beggining, the Internet was supposed to be the ultimate tool for sharing of information and free knowledge, and bring the whole world together. Fast forward 30 years and well, we all know what the Internet really is today, right?

Let me be clear, I'm not saying the Internet is a bad thing. I think is a wonderful concept. But human nature does not deal very well with wonderful things. It always ends up boiling things down to a matter of dominance. And it will do the same with crypto.

I think a common goal in the crypto space is for it to somehow go mainstream but as for right now, I struggle to find reasons as to why an average person who has no interest in trading/investing can benefit from it. 

If somebody asks tells you that they are interested in crypto and the hype how would you introduce them?

I think this is how I would introduce because it’s how I got into it.

2. Start with a small sum that their willing to lose to buy an amount of 3-5 or so different coins.

Many_Arm7466,"Originally I was going to go out for dinner and drinks with some friends but plans ended up being cancelled. 

Later that evening I ended up coming across the most ludicrous new released shitcoin I had ever seen on Binance Scam Chain. And figured I’d throw a $100 as that’s what I would have spent on the night out. 

This was just purely for shits and giggles and I forgot about it a week later I checked the charts of the shitcoin just to see how much it would be down only to find out it had gone on an insane run and I was in profit to the tune of thousands of dollars. 

Of course I took out 40x my investment and let the rest ride as a clown market shit happens insurance. But as I was cashing out in increments as I had enough to completely tank the price.

I joined the Telegram just to see if there was any news. And nope zero news whatsoever... just a ton of shilling and hype and getting new suckers to buy into the shitcoin with zero usecase. Someone new would ask if they are still early and how to buy and all the shillers would say “it’s the next Shib” and “hop in don’t miss the 1000x”. 

And seeing all the buy orders with some people throwing in thousands I just felt bad. As I was dumping my bags to the next lineup of idiots while making a killing. And the pump is unsustainable so they will likely be left holding their bags.

After researching how criminals use cryptocurrency to evade taxes, and launder money, I decided to see what else criminals use to do illegal things. 

I found that many are using the ocean by placing boats on it to transport drugs, weapons, and stolen goods.     

  If you support using the ocean , you support it's existence, and as long as we keep using the ocean to fish, going on trips, and swim, we are indirectly telling criminals that they have the ability to use the ocean too...  For their illegal activities.  And I'm taking a stand now, and never using the ocean for anything again. 

The fact is, deep in international waters, there isn't much regulation.  There isn't enough eyes on it, and anything can be going on out there.    Especially pirates.  

So one someone tells you they like going in the ocean, remind them of all the illegal things that take place in it.    They should feel bad.     Educate them on the dangers.",0,"Because of Cryptocurrency, I'm never going to be able to swim in the ocean ever again."
Double_d5050,"Just a little tip to help some of the new people in crypto. If you are making profit on a coin and want to cash out so you can invest in another always use the convert option. When you sell and invest in another coin there is the fee you will pay. The fee equals losing money, not a lot depending on how much you are cashing out but that fee can go in another coin instead of losing it. When you convert your profit to another coin you get more of that coin than you would selling and buying that coin. 

I've been doing this the whole time since I've been I crypto and it has compounded my money over time. I'm not going to lie, I cashed out once and realized I made a amateur mistake. Only cash out if you need the money

fuzzyduck88,"So to start I want to clarify: this is NOT for tax purposes or ANYTHING to do with tax. Also as a matter of FACT this would also NOT be classed as money laundering as one of the proofs for money laundering is that the money was the “proceeds of criminal conduct”. It’s fully legal to hide any legitimate money. Please don’t turn it into a conversation about anything illegal. There are strict rules here. 

This came to light from a conversation I was having with a friend about divorce and the the age old myth of losing your keys “in a boating accident” so that you wouldn’t have to give away half. 

I’m not getting divorced or anything. This was about a famous person who had recently been divorced and practically lost everything and how he could have avoided it. 

Although there’s no way of proving the keys weren’t lost in an accident I don’t believe this would last in court given the burden of proof in civil cases is only based on probability. If it would be safe to say “given the facts heard, he probably didn’t lose the keys”…then you’re screwed. 
This is obviously different to a criminal case where it has to be proved beyond reasonable doubt. 

So, back to the beginning. How would one hide their crypto so it’s impossible for someone with full access to your bank accounts to to determine if you own some or not?(I.e - they can see you deposited money on an exchange). Or is it even possible?

My theory was the best way is to “muddy the waters” to an extent that it just becomes impossible to determine where the money is. (was it spent, gambled, invested further etc). To do this would mean spending a bit on fees:

(1)Transfer from exchange to a private wallet.
(2) Transfer from wallet to gambling site
(3) Transfer from gambling site to another wallet. 
(4) Transfer from wallet to a new unused hardware wallet such as trezor etc. 
(5) Bury wallet for years.

I’ve seen too many people saying “If Bitcoin is at $60.000 it shouldn’t be very difficult for SHIBA INU to reach $1”. Nope, that’s not how it works. You can’t compare the price of cryptocurrencies by their USD value, because they have different amounts in supply. 

**2-** **Not having a strategic plan**

This is a common mistake made by many beginners that start investing before having a plan. They end up buying too late or selling too early for not having an entrance/exit strategy.

**3-** **Getting Scared of Market Volatility**

You can’t expect a 10x in your portfolio if you can’t handle a +20% loss. A lot of newbies get scared of market volatility and end up panic selling. But if you want to stick around you need to understand that cryptocurrencies are very volatile.

**4-** **Falling for Scams**

There are all types of scams (influencers promoting a scam coin, fake emails or fake promotions), but it’s crucial to recognize them if you don’t want to lose all your money. Why would a random person double the amount of money you send him? Exactly, never give personal information to nobody. 

**5-** **Being too lazy to DYOR**

Too many people want to get rich in crypto yet are too lazy to do mínimum research.  If you don’t understand the crypto you’re investing in and only listen to “experts”, you will get into big trouble and lose a lot of money.

**6-** **Investing money they can’t afford to lose**

A lot of beginners throw all their savings or loan funds to crypto without considering that they could lose it. Always remember, don’t invest what you can’t afford to lose.

**7-** **FOMO’ing/FUD**

Falling for FOMO or FUD is something that almost everyone fall for when entering the crypto space. It’s important to not fall for emotions when investing/trading so you don’t get too greedy and end up losing money.

**8-** **Not diversifying**

You should diversify even when you think you’ve found a sure thing, it simply doesn’t hurt you to have more variety. On the other hand, when you’re starting in crypto you should stick to a few crypto with good fundamentals that you clearly understand them.

**9-** **Trading**

If you’re not a professional, just stick to investing. All you have to do is buy,hodl and DCA, you will not time the market so strop trying to sell at peak prices.

**10-**  **Following trends**

So you look at your portfolio and it's worth millions or whatever magic number is your make it number. Now what? Do you immediately cash out to fiat or stable realizing your gains? What about the tax implications, you know Uncle Sam wants his fair share. Do you contact your financial advisor to book a meeting and discuss best course of action? But Crypto is volatile by the time you do that your gains could be gone. Hmm maybe you're thinking screw the IRS, do you convert your Crypto to monero and get in a ""boating accident""?

Then what about celebration let's face it we would be so excited that we'd have to tell someone! Can't keep all this excitement to ourselves. Do you immediately hop on social media and let everybody know you're a millionaire? Got to show off your gains and flex on everyone. With the possibility of making yourself a target? Or do you only tell wives and inner circle? Do you trust your inner circle to not tell others or set up an elaborate plan to kill you and get your private keys?

And what about transfer to an exchange? Do you true your test transaction? Or do you do multiple test transactions? Do you send your Crypto all at once? 

And how about deposit it to your bank if you decide to go that route. Would they put the transfer on hold? Isn’t strange that someone with $11.37 in their bank account is depositing 1 million. Would they think you’re dealing drugs?

NoahsArkJP,"Do you think we will one day see a crypto currency that has built in rules similar to what the fed would  use to maximize economic well being? As I see it now, crypto currencies like bitcoin have several advantages over fiat currency- they can't be over printed, there is a fixed supply, and there is no central point of failure. The one disadvantage I see is the inelasticity of a crypto currency with a fixed amount in circulation. Economists regularly argue that a currency should be able to expand to meet the needs of trade. The problem is that when you have a group of people deciding when to expand it and by how much, then human error plays a role (i.e. it can be over printed beyond the legitimate needs of the economy). So why not a crypto currency that has the decentralized advantage combined with the advantages of a currency that can expand as needed? This currency, instead of being controlled by a group of people, would be controlled by an artificial intelligence which takes inputs from economic indicators and decides just how much new token should be added every year.",0,A best of both worlds crypto currency.
knowledgelover94,"I’m no expert so I really would like to hear contrasting views, but in my short time dabbling into defi, Avalanche seems to be doing what Ethereum hoped to do but more efficiently. 

I honestly don’t understand how anyone but rich people manage to use Ethereum these days with their high gas fees and transaction costs. It costs like $15 to do anything. I know there are possible solutions coming, but it’ll probably be a while. 

It only cost me like $.3 to put coins onto Aave using avalanche. How can Ethereum compete with that? 

Of course there are other coins that compete with avalanche. SOL and ALGO are pretty centralized compared to avalanche. Cardano and polkadot don’t seem to have the biggest selection of dapps as of yet (why aren’t they on Aave?)

Avalanche seems to have a bunch of extra things going for it too like how it’s easy to bridge between Ethereum and avalanche and its multiple block chains.

thisiswhining,"I recently learned that Soviet scientists had been working on a information network in the early 1960s, analogous to the modern internet, that was denied funding in the 1970s and therefore never materialized. The National Automated System for Computation and Information Processing (OGAS) was pioneered by Victor Glushkov. While reading a book dedciated to the topic I came across something I thought some here might find interesting.

Glushkov saw the future of soviet economy to be “incrementally organized into a cybernetically balanced network of labor, production, and consumption inputs and outputs” and therefore he saw good reason to “virtualize currency itself and make the exchange of funds take place by ""electronic receipt.""” He wanted to remove the need for a hard currency and allow all economic exchanges to take place on the OGAS network. In this original draft paper for the network system he proposed to “eliminate all paper currency, providing in its place wire­less money transfers, or a ""moneyless system of receipts"" over the OGAS network.”

*Glushkov is the on the right, sitting in the chair.*

The ""moneyless system of receipts"" sounds familiar doesn't it?
Naturally, had any such system been implemented in the Soviet Union, it would have been totally centralized, but it's still very interesting to see such early mention of a fully virtual currency.

""Been using OKEx for some time, their spot and margin trading is great, no issues encountered so far.   
Withdrawal and deposits are also normal hence, I decided to try using their perpetual trading to leverage my position in order to maximize my profits.

Note that I only have one position opened at that point in time as well.   
Unfortunately, the price of BTC went up and boom, at 64,282.7 USDT, OKEx decided to liquidate me at a PnL ratio of -55.22%.   
This was a shock to me as the liquidation reason provided was cross margin ratio dropping lower than 100%.   
U can see clearly that my PnL is only -282.73 USDT which I should have not been liquidated in the first place and the worst part, they charged a total of 571.99 USDT to my trading account! Isn’t that daylight robbery?       
There online support is next to non-existent as they will just keep telling that they will help to escalate the case to their relevant team which is their technical department and even after 4 days, no follow up is given.

shypooper69,"
I myself was a newbie without a proper guidance , I invested lot of my money in meme and shit coins with low market cap in expections of huge gains but that didn't happen . Just a few basics Really can change the game for the new folks .

1. DCA in and DCA out - DCA means dollar cost average your money when you enter and when you leave the market , that is investing a previously thought amount of money irrespective the price of the asset. It removes your emotions and fluctuations in the price. And so if you believe in a project and know it's good in the long term , DCA is the best.




2. DYOR or Stay in top 20 ! - research low market cap projects thoroughly or to be safe you can stay in the top 20 crypto which have a good reputation like DOT LINK MATIC ALGO ETH BTC.







3. Stay away from Meme coins - You may gain some profits from them but this will ruin your discipline and Can Be vey bad in the long run ( I have a post about it already you can check it out) 






4. Buy Red Sell Green !! such a simple thing but people still struggle with it !!
People buy in Euphoria when the market is going up and sell in panic when the market is going down ...

ilovepussygrool,"Back in December 2020 I bought my first ever crypto because of one of my good friends. He basically shilled the hell out of XRP when it was around 20 cents and told me how valuable it was going to be. I decided to throw in a couple hundred and see where it went. 

Come February I had a few thousand in it and it was peaking around 50-60 cents. I thought to myself “there’s no way this goes higher. This is my chance to make money off of this gamble that I took.” So I sold for a small profit. I would have come close to 10xing it if I had held. 

The same goes for SOL which I bough back in January when it was a modest $12. Sold at 70 and have regretted it ever since. 

My advice is this: before you sell make sure you understand what you’re doing. I’ve always believed in taking profits but the best advice I have heard in crypto was this: “I always hear about people saying they shouldn’t have sold as early.

xdev123,"Just found out about this and thought it was pretty cool that the Swedish companies registration office (Bolagsverket) is experimenting with Ethereum to store certificates in the blockchain.

You can read more about it here (paywall and in swedish) https://www.di.se/digital/bolagsverkets-kryptosatsning-testar-verifieringstjanst-i-ethereum/?fbclid=IwAR0hPFInKuk2Q97CvslbTbTeKS1FpHOZtuMo-wCcqdr3ypfJvi21TYmmVS0

sothalone,"Been using OKEx for some time, their spot and margin trading is great, no issues encountered so far. Started to use their perpetual trading to leverage my position in order to maximize my profits. 

Firstly, my position was liquidated at a PnL ratio of -55.22% which some may say maybe I have more than one position opened so the cross margin would have wiped me out but no, I only had one position worth 1 BTC opened at that point in time.

Secondly, my trading account had a balance of 571 USDT which u can see from my screenshot. With a sell position of 1 BTC opened at 64,000 USDT and for OKEx to liquidate me at 64,282.7 USDT is simply shocking. Not only should my loss only be -282.73 USDT which shouldn't happen in the first place as my PnL isn't even close to -100% which they claim to liquidate me at, they charged a total of 571.99 USDT to my trading account! Isn't this daylight robbery? 

There online support is next to non existent as they will just keep telling u that the technical team is looking into it and even after 4 days no proper answer is given. Take this as an experience and likely the sum involved isn't alot but if u are ever using OKEx, i would strongly advice to stay away from their perpetual.

Element_89,"Hello all,

I left Australia for Germany in Nov last year and have been a German tax resident since my arrival.

Confused how the double tax treaty works when it comes to my CGT gains (hoping to find guidance here from tax savvy ppl).

My understanding of how I would split my CGT liabilities is below, but hoping someone may have been through this before could verify?

I leave Australia for Germany in Nov 2020:
- I need to pay tax on any Australian gains between the start of the Australian tax year (July 1st 2020) to the date I left (Nov 2020)
-  On top of this, I need to also pay Australian exit tax on any unrealised gains on the date I leave.

Live in Germany from Nov 2020 – present
- I need to pay income tax from my arrival date on any short and long term gains. Long term gains are 0%.

Question - I am unclear how my cost basis would be calculated in Germany with a double tax treaty? Considering I will have paid exit tax in Australia, would that mean my German cost basis the same as my Australian exit tax proceeds?

If so, what does this mean for any long term gains discounts in Germany? i.e. if I bring over assets I've held for more than a year, can I still realise a 0% tax in Germany? Or.... because I have paid Australian exit tax - are these assets considered to have been ‘sold’ on the date I left Australia?

Depending on how I calculate this has a huge effect on my tax hit... any help greatly appreciated!",0,Moved from Australia to Germany to realise crypto gains - how to split tax between countries?

TheRealJanMarsalek,"1. **The Dusting Attack**  
This is a scam where you will receive very tiny amounts of crypto, also known as dust, to a lot of addresses. The criminals will watch these wallets that thye've sent the dust to, to see if they can de-anonymize the wallet owner. Once they've identified the owner, they can set up more elegant phishing attempts to sweep the funds from the owner's wallets. Or, they may even physically target the owner to get them to give up the keys. Best way to protect yourself from this would be to leave the dust where it is. Do not touch it, do not interact with it in any way. And most of all, don't bother trying to sell it.
2. **The Clipboard Malware**  
This one is where your device has been infected with a malware that changes the address that you have copied and pasted from your clipboard. The malware can swap the addresses to the hacker's own address, or to a random string of characters. When that transaction goes through, you'd have lost that crypto to the hacker or just poof, thin air. To avoid this scam, make sure that your device is clean, and not infected with any kind of virus. Keep your antivirus software up to date. When you copy and paste your addresses, double, no triple check to make sure you're sending it to the right address.
3. **The Hot Lady in Your DM**  
Gentlemen, this scam is the one that targets your primal brain. A very attractive woman often dressed scantily with big boobs (sorry) may show up in your DMs asking you about crypto and try to chat you up. This eventually leads to ""her"" manipulating you into giving up your 12 word phrases or passwords. They may try to initiate exchange of nudes for crypto. They may even have a sob story and make you feel bad into sending her crypto. Best way to not fall for this, is to always remember that ""if a hot lady DMs you about crypto, ignore him"". Another variation of this is the ""send me crypto I'll double it for you."" or the ""Investor"" who thinks you're so special and wants to help you. There is no free lunch in this world. Nobody here is looking out for others by giving you free crypto (except moons of course). Personally, I avoid talking to anyone via DMs on here.
4. **The ""Helpful"" Support Team in Your DM**  
This one is where a support team ""member"" from the project DMs you via Telegram or reddit to help you validate your wallet. This is an attempt to get you to divulge your private keys, or they'll link you to a phishing site that looks legit to get you to key in your 12 word phrase. It is very common to get some attention from scammers in your DMs when you've just posted a question on a subreddit or telegram group. To protect yourself, remember not to entertain any kind of DMs from anyone. Do not click on any links, and most importantly do not give anyone your private keys.
5. **The Rugpull**  
Rugpulls happen all the time, and even billionaires have fallen victim to them. This is a scam where the developers of the smart contract, or the project drain the funds from the liquidity pool. This is especially common in De-Fi, and have been on the rise as well. The best way to not fall victim to it, is to make sure you invest in projects that have fully doxxed and trusted developers &amp; have trusted smart contracts. Of course, not everyone's gonna go through the code to make sure that the code is clean. There are third party companies that do contract auditing, such as Certik. This is where DYOR comes in. Personally I would avoid Binance Smart Chain projects altogether, cuz that's where i've experienced many rugpulls.
6. **The Honeypot**  
This is a very common scam that I've experienced quite a few times in Binance Smart Chain ""projects"". The scam is very simple. The contract is written in a way where you can buy the token, but selling will be impossible. So if you're watching the charts, and you've thrown money in there, you'll see the value rising. However, when you're ready to sell, you'll notice that you won't be able to. The best way to avoid such a scam is just to watch the transactions on BSCscanner, to make sure that buy and sell transactions are going through to unique addresses.
7. **The Attack of the Clones**  
Another kind of phishing attack, where you might get an seemingly legit looking email from an exchange, with a link contained within the email, or clicking on links from untrusted sources. These links may lead to websites that look like the carbon copy of the original website. There might be a security notification telling you to key in your seed phrase. When you do key it in, the hackers will own your crypto, and can simply sweep your wallet clean. To avoid this, you should double check the url of the site you're using, as they often look dodgy, with a .org or a .net extension. For instance you may click on a link that takes you to ""pomhub.com"" instead of the actual site. To protect yourself, bookmark the actual links to the exchanges, instead of clicking random links.
8. **Pump and Dump**  
There are many telegram groups that organize planned pumps and dumps, hoping that others will FOMO in and buy in. Once the price has pumped, the people who are in on it will dump their positions, causing significant loss to the ones who had FOMO'd in. Often times, the owners of the project may be in on it, and may even pay influencers to shill the project. When the coin has pumped enough, they will just dump their positions and pocket the profits. To avoid this, just don't FOMO into projects. Don't listen to some influencer with 1 hit song back in 2013 to make financial decisions.

Then I asked my friend how was he buying B.T.C. and he took added me to a Facebook page.

theycallmelopez,"TLDR; Man facing years in federal prison for not declaring his gains to the fiscal authories in France after he received a speed ticket in a Lambo. - Always fill in your taxes unless you are part of the ""1%"".

A man in France is under arrest because he was hiding assets in cryptocurrency from the fiscal authorities. 

After a speed ticket was given to him for riding too fast with a Lambo, police launched an investigation and it appeared that the individual's lifestyle didn't match the declared revenus/assets. 

His explanation is that the speed at which he was gaining those assets didn't give him enough time to declare the gains to the authorities and also the lack of knowledge on how to declare them has prevented him from doing so too. Obviously, the judge didn't buy the excuse, thus a fraud investigation was launched.

At the 1 bedroom appartment of this man, they found the following items;

- 10 gold ingots (1kg/ingot)
- 250 pure gold and silver coins (value ~500k€)
- 1.5M€ in crypto assets in his cold wallets on the computer.

It is also discovered that he made several trips abroad to sell the gold and silver he had in his possession. It is the way he chose to convert crypto to fiat. Thus adding a money laundering charge into the case.

This happened this week, no updates have been done in regards to this matter as investigation is still ongoing.

Moral of the story, ALWAYS declare your gains unless you're part of the 1%. We clearly don't have the same rights, and unless things change, it is what it is, don't risk years in prison after all the efforts you've done in crypto.

XxLetsgetrichxX,"

Everyone needs to read this, stay safe out there it is a dangerous place to be if you haven't put the research work in.

If you are in this group and you are a begginer I really want you to consider this when you are investing. 

I don’t consider myself a skilled developer and in fact I know very little, to nothing, about coding. When it come to being technical, I'm the guy who refers you to my buddy lol.

Now, I've been trying to dig more into the tech behind crypto and found a lot of things  confusing, but, all technology aside, I was curious as to what creating and launching a coin really ment.

Fact is, after 1 google search and 20 minutes, I could transfer $100 to a ETH wallet and create a coin with a 50 million supply with a few clicks and copy and paste.

The entire thing took less than an hour.

Let’s say today I created a coin with a 50 trillion supply and sent 25 trillion to someone else. 

Now I really want everyone to think about the fact that a person with no real technical understanding could create a coin in under an hour. I'm sure everyone in this group probably could too after watching a few tutorial. 

For an extra $50 I could put up a website and another 10k on a copywriter, I could easily launch an ico and sell a shit ton of these useless tokens promising things that don't even exist.

Its actually pretty easy to get listed on exchanged and coin market cap if you create enough hype and trading volume around your coin as well. Just meet their criteria and apply.

This is what 90% of the stuff in crypto is, nothing more than a coin that took 20 minutes to make and $100. I want everyone new in this group to realize that 99% of the promises that cryptocurrency and blockchain projects have are in things that do not exist and tech that hasn't even been developed yet.

This is why all this is so exciting but also so scary.

Before you invest in a coin do you ask who are the developers on a project? What funding do they have? Do they even have a working platform? If not, What's the application they are working for and what are their benchmarks? Is the coin actually used to power the tech or is it just a ""coin"" that has no real function?

The reason why people spend hours really digging into these coins and the projects behind them is because it's extremely important to understand the REAL risk.

Anyone can create a coin in 1 hour put up a website in an a day, and have a ico promising pipe dreams ready to launch in a week, in a world with no rules or regulations. 

There are just over 13000 different crypto currency’s,(based on Coinmarketcap) how many of these do you think offer actual use cases? How many do you think are a scam? My guess is probably about 90%

In a nutshell I created a crypto trading algorithm that can scans the Binance announcement page, and when Binance announces that they will  be listing a new coin, the bot will automatically place a buy order on Gate. io. 

I've observed that coins shoot  up when Binance announces that they will list them, and people rush to buy it on other exchanges in anticipation of the listing - creating a snowball effect. The crypto trading bot aims to take advantage of that and ride this spike that can sometimes reach 10x.

Manually trading it would be impossible, so a tool is needed to act quickly.

While underdeveloped countries in Africa face the threat of unsustainable population growth and limited resources, many wealthy nations have the opposite problem – a declining population that could pose a threat to the future of humanity.

People in general have become less intelligent, due to simplified way of life because of the technological peaks that we've achieved since the industrialization of things.

They didn't have the ability to have their tentacles in it to control price and profits.  Well guess what people.  Now they do.  They will short it to cap gains and go long when others sell.  It will be a cluster fuck of price control leading to them getting rich and us losing.   Oh - and lest us not forget - the finite supply of Bitcoin.

Klaasiker,"Let's turn the time back to 2017.

Crypto wasn't really my thing but I started to gain information and was really curious about the world of Crypto. So back at my workplace a colleague came up to me and told me about that really interesting and safe company located in Mexico called Masbitcoin.

As I didn't knew much of it I went on Google and searched to find stuff about them. And Oh boy did I miss those Red Flags. They had a system where you get 60% of your investment every 60 days. So if you invest $500 you get $300 bucks every 60 days. If you recruit others into the ""company"" you'd get your money earlier than after 60 days. If you invest more you'd obviously get bigger gains.

To be honest: I was curious. So the Work-Colleague did set up a profile for me. In the meanwhile I bought my first ever Crypto and ""prepared"" myself to invest about $2000 into Masbitcoin. But in the end something in my head said: go for the smallest investment and I listened to myself and ""only"" invested $250 into Masbitcoin. All the other coworkers took way way bigger investments like $2000. 

So after investing I saw in the pyramid that my Co-Worker placed me above all other Co-Workers. Per Person which gets placed beneath you you'll get the money 3 days earlier so after 45 days I really got 60% percent of my investment back ($150). Now all the other Co-Workers realized that this ""works"" and started to invest even more. 

Skip forward 60 days. I should get my next payment by now. I never wanted to ask others to invest as I don't like to give financial advice to others. And oh wonder: We all didn't get paid.

The homepage was down. All numbers were blocked and you had no way to get into connection with Masbitcoin.

I learned my lesson with a loss of $100. Luckily the BTC prize increased and the amount of BTC I still had in my wallet easily covered my loss.

My Co-Workers lost it all as they didn't own Crypto next to their investment into Masbitcoin.

This was the last thing I ever heard about Masbitcoin: [https://bitcoinexchangeguide.com/masbitcoin-ceo-jorge-sanchezs-bodyguards-gunned-down-in-mexico/](https://bitcoinexchangeguide.com/masbitcoin-ceo-jorge-sanchezs-bodyguards-gunned-down-in-mexico/)

Knew from the announcements they were working on it so thought I’d just wait and hope something changes soon. Noticed firmware 2.0 was available, also connected my Nano x to my ledger live on desktop and noticed it is actually displaying all of my rewards for past 13 dates and the relevant updated actual amount of DOT.

I completed update 2.0 hoping it would update my dot like my desktop live. After completing update it still showed the amount of DOT before UI stopped working. 

So I deleted the DOT account to re-add it hoping it would sync and update, but when I try to add the account it fails at the 3 of 3 synchronisation stage, with the error message;

Prab1472,"Using Leverage without its knowledge. Just so you can utilize leverage on a centralized exchange like Binance, you need to use leverage correctly. 

The reason is that you're using borrowed money to trade with someone else's money, in this case the exchanges money, and you're taking on increased risk in order to use that money. For example, if the market moves 10% in your favor, you make 10x gains using 10x leverage, but if the market moves 10% in the opposite direction, you make 10x losses.

robotmole,"So we know that the future will encompass a variety of coins and chains that fill different roles. There is no need for one to try and tackle every use case and be solely responsible for all financial applications.

Am I leading myself into a rug pull?

I'd love to hear both sides of the argument.
