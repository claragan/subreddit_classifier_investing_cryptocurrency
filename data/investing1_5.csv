EselSchwanz,1635167216,"I'm 25 years old and just inherited a portion of the family company which sums up to about $950k, and I have a buyer at any time if I were to decide to liquidate. This started paying about $1800/month this year, which is a lot to me but less than 2.5% of the total amount. This is a crazy, game changing opportunity for me to reinvest into something that will grow my wealth as well as pay enough monthly to live off of and pursue interests/ventures even if I only make a 5% cap, but I'm really wary to do so now.

The company is currently growing and I have no idea what I'd invest in to begin with and I'm afraid of two things: 1. Never liquidating and regretting it because of the potential 2. Making bad investments and losing everything. 3. The company doubling in size and losing out on having doubled equity with no effort within the next few years

The thing is, though, that $950k is more than enough for me, and I'm young. I could pursue business interests, invest in something to pour my time/energy into, move anywhere. I'm just wary on what to do and I'm a little overwhelmed. Any advice?",investing,Inherited large amount of equity.. Not sure whether to liquidate and invest now or wait

* How old are you? What country do you live in?

* What are your objectives with this money? (Buy a house? Retirement savings?)  
* What is your time horizon? Do you need this money next month? Next 20yrs?  
* What is your risk tolerance? (Do you mind risking it at blackjack or do you need to know its 100% safe?)
