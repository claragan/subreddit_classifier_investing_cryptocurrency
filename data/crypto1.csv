Markmanus,1635177574,"So I have to assume as the title says above. In the last couple of weeks, especially since CDC ([Crypto.com](https://Crypto.com)) started their aggressive marketing around summer they had a large % growth in volume and overall global presence. I have noticed that CDC has different statistics on different crypto analysis websites.  


First I thought it was just a normal difference as it is not easy to collect statistical data especially with high accuracy, but then I have noticed the difference is happening on Coinmarketcap, while other sites show same data...then I remembered that Binance purchased coinmarketcap, and I decided to dive into this investigation.

&amp;#x200B;

# Coinmarketcap statistics.

Binance first in ranking While CDC only able to grab the 21st based on coinmarketcap ""Custom"" ranking system.

Binance reported a 26.826 Billion in Volume

While they only reported a 561 Million for Crypto.Com

# Livecoinwatch statistics

Surprisingly a more independent website reports are greatly different from the one above.

Binance volume is barely 25 Billion

[Crypto.com](https://Crypto.com) volume is 2.73 Billion (5 times more than on coinmarketcap)

There is still a good 10X difference in volume, but just 4 months ago this number was a 100.  


I know both exchanges are centralized, but for me [crypto.com](https://crypto.com) earned way more respect as they refused to ban validators on their chain who regularly changed commission and with that kinda scamming staking people, because they want to be decentralised as possible, instead they created a warning and marked validators in the ranking so people know they tend to change commission regularly.",CryptoCurrency,Is Binance afraid of Crypto.com?
frostybitz,1635177350,"We've all made silly mistakes since our inception in the cryptoverse.

https://www.npr.org/2021/10/25/1048485043/irs-banks-taxes-fight-explainer



Obvious issues here:

*Violations of privacy. Like...holy shit GTFO and stop looking at my bank account Karen.

*Individuals *are not* the problem - corporations exploiting tax loopholes and tax havens are the real issue here. Unchecked power, etc.

*Forces people to use shady methods of concealing transactions. Obviously not an up and up thing, but also...Monero exists.

*This is absolutely an attack on crypto, but with a different approach than ""regulate"".

There was massive backlash, so it was scaled up to $10,000.


But here is the reality we are all in:

If we cash out any crypto to a form of Fiat that has to go through a US bank account to clear that now gets slammed by the IRS. Now again, it's a near-0% chance you are audited (especially unelder $400k/yr income).


But say you made out amazingly well on something.

Say you dropped $10k into SHIB, and now you are up to $20k (it was up 99% for the year as of the other day IIRC). Maybe you YOLO'D into it with $50k or $100k, and now you cashed out and made $100k or $200k.

This gets painful as the numbers go up. And while I understand the average person here has sub $1k invested don't be fooled that this isn't a dig at lower income stuff.

Maybe you get WIC or food stamps or some type of supplemental income. Well suddenly the IRS sees your extra few grand distribution and now you get a letter telling you that you no longer qualify for that benefit. Puts a real damper on any future investing. Probably kills it for you outright or at least for a couple of years until you stabilize again.


This is another form of suppression plain and simple.

I haven‚Äôt been able to send any of my coins to a different wallet for months now. I‚Äôve successfully sent some coins to my Gemini wallet maybe 3-4 months ago but then out of nowhere I could only send a small amount (less than $100) and then a couple days later I couldn‚Äôt send anything. Now I when I try to send my coin to a different wallet I get a message on the bottom in red letters that says ‚ÄúWithdrawal amount too high. You currently may withdraw at most $77.83 (or equivalent), due to pending deposits. First of all, I have no pending deposits. Second, the amount they say I can withdraw up to changes every time I try to withdraw and is a random number like the one above (ex. $66.72, $200.87, $100.82, etc.). Not even every day, every single attempt I make it changes to a random number. Sometimes when the system gives me a higher amount like $100-$200 I try to send it to my Gemini wallet (because for specific coins you can only send it to a different wallet if you‚Äôre sending over a certain number‚Äîfor example you can only send MATIC if you have 100+ coins) and then I get a pop up message that says ‚ÄúTransaction cannot be completed.

DeliciousAd3885,1635176568,"TradeStrike is excited to announce that we have integrated Chainlink Price Feeds into our upcoming DEX platform; TradeStrike Lite ‚Äî on BSC. Chainlink will feed decentralized data feeds into our DEX dashboard, giving users real-time, and industry-leading benchmarks on various crypto-assets in order to make informed trading decisions. Our initial integration involves price feeds for BNB, BTC, USDT, BUSD, and LINK ‚Äî with the ability to easily scale up to more assets in the future.

The integration marks the beginning of an ongoing commitment to exclusively use Chainlink Price Feeds across ALL of our upcoming products. As a next step, we plan to integrate Chainlink Price Feeds directly in our TradeStrike Wallet.

We selected Chainlink because it‚Äôs the most time-tested price feed solution in the industry, already helping secure tens of billions of dollars in value for leading decentralized and centralized financial products. Chainlink Price Feeds offer premium data quality with wide market coverage, as well as robust oracle infrastructure that maintains high uptime and tamper-resistance. By incorporating decentralized infrastructure like Chainlink, TradeStrike is able to offer increased transparency and reliability into the data relied on by traders while still maintaining strong precision and low update latency.

While our DEX will facilitate price discovery through spot markets, it‚Äôs important for users to have reliable benchmarks on assets as aggregated from across all exchanges. This will allow users to make even more precise decisions when trading as they can compare TradeStrike‚Äôs native DEX prices against the broader market.
After reviewing various centralized and decentralized data solutions, we found 
Chainlink Price Feeds to offer a superior solution, which uniquely combined accuracy, transparency, and robustness. Some of the key features of Chainlink Price Feeds:

High-Quality Data ‚Äî Chainlink Price Feeds source data from numerous premium data aggregators, leading to price data that‚Äôs aggregated from hundreds of exchanges, weighted by volume, and cleaned from outliers and suspicious volumes. Chainlink‚Äôs data aggregation model generates more precise global market prices that are resistant to API downtime, flash crash outliers, and data manipulation attacks.

High Update Frequency ‚Äî Chainlink Price Feeds on high-performance blockchains can perform frequent price updates at minimal costs, resulting in precise price data that consistently reflects current market conditions.
Robust Infrastructure ‚Äî Chainlink Price Feeds utilize decentralized networks of professional node operators run by leading blockchain DevOps teams and traditional enterprises with a strong track record of uptime during market volatility.

Transparent Monitoring ‚Äî Chainlink provides a robust reputation framework and set of on-chain monitoring tools that allow users to independently verify the historical and real-time performance of price feeds.

I hope this post is not against certain guidelines and rules, I‚Äôm relatively new to the crypto market and just wanted to get an input from some of the more experienced people. 

I‚Äôve recently got into a coin, which had at first glance, ample buy demand (thick buy wall) and relatively small sell wall. 

Got to admit got a bit of a FOMO at first and put in an order to a relatively high price. Bought it and was waiting for it to go up, which giving the relatively healthy buy order all, it did. 

Half a day later I began to notice that although ample volume of trading was being done, the price stayed barely above the price I bought it at and I would notice this glitch like in-and-out numbers in the order lists. I did some digging and learned about the whole spoofing phenomenon. Liceu and learn, right?

So my question to the more veteran traders here is - what is the best course of action when you see that the currency price is being spoofed for 2 days straight and the spoofing is done on both sides of the order book (on buy and sell)?

# What is it?

Theta represents a complex and extensive project associated with several purposes. The primary one, on which its business model is based, is about the structuring of a platform (precisely called Theta), able to offer video streaming services, exploiting the potential of the blockchain.  The streaming sector itself, as everyone knows, has been among the most developed markets over the last 5 years. The development of online platforms, centralized and headed by private organizations, has had the ability to revolutionize the world of visual entertainment.  In all this, Theta, through its technology, is trying to propose an alternative system, which we could define 4.0, completely decentralized, that is, based on the very presence of the network and on anyone willing to use the same services. Following are the main current issues that Theta is trying to solve:

* **Slow buffering**: centralized platforms, given the numerous overloads and considerable amounts of data, very often fail to offer clear and smooth resolutions and exposures. Theta aims to solve this through a process of sharing broadband power by interested users.
* **Lower costs**: centralized platforms, given the numerous costs to be incurred for infrastructures and so on, very often provide lower returns to content creators (the so-called streamers). The centralized nature of Theta aims to guarantee improvements also in this respect.
* **Rewards for everyone**: through the new generation Peer to Peer system, Theta aims to be able to offer to participants (i.e. those who make their power available to keep the system active) rewards in the form of tokens.

# How does it work?

The video streaming sector, having as its main object providing content with a significant ""weight"", is associated with an enormous exchange of data. This aspect represented one of the first problems to be solved by the foundation at the head of the project. A second relevant aspect, present in this case due to the process of distribution of bonuses to those who participate in the provision of resources to keep the system active, concerns the amount (millions) of micropayments. How has Theta solved these aspects, allowing to structure a system of sharing, obtaining bandwidth and distribution of rewards? Through its internal structures based on:  Internal Theta network with node links and Theta blockchain.

* **Theta network**: the fundamental pillar concerns the internal network. It is a singular network, similar to a mesh network, which allows fast communication  between the nodes inside.  In turn, the internal communications of the nodes allow on the one hand to allow the collective system for making the band available (by users who decide to accept the process) and on the other to guarantee the maintenance of shares and visuals.  In other words, a single user, wishing to benefit from the service, can make part of his power available, in order to collaborate in the creation of the network of nodes, receiving in exchange tokens. A simple system in its complexity, to allow cost reductions (linked to traditional systems) and high quality video, linked to the nodes
* **Theta blockchain**: the Theta blockchain has been specially structured to meet the needs set out above, one of which is the immense amount of data to be managed. One of the first solutions, in this case in association with the problem of creating and structuring micropayments, concerns the Resource Oriented Micropayment Pool system.  Through it, it is possible to take advantage of the formation of very small off-chain payments, in turn associated with a network of withdrawals. The same technology has now opened the doors to new projects, all focused on the world of digitized payments.  Beyond micropayments, moving to data processing, the Theta organization had to look for a system to greatly increase the scope and capacity of the ecosystem (in other words, to continuously generate and ensure high throughput). To do this, it uses a Multi Level BTF (Byzantine Fault Tolerance) mechanism and a multi-layer system.

# Where to store it?

The best hot wallet for THETA are Theta Wallet, Trust Wallet and Atomic Wallet. If you want more security, a cold storage like Ledger or Trezor is the right choice.

sergelevrai5,1635174004,"Hi everyone, so a thought occurred to me. We have $ backed stablecoin, gold and silver stablecoins on the way, but has anyone thought of creating a coin backed by actual real life land property?

The main advantage I see here is that land is actually of finite scarcity, on the contrary of $ (and gold on a smaller scale).

This is how I'm picturing it:
A fund buys a huge land property somewhere, for example 1M acres, and sells 1M token (1/acre) at double or triple the cost.
They have to sell it at a higher price, because the land needs investments in order to be managed in a sustainable and profitable way.

Then if you buy a token, part of this token represents the land and another part represents the capital linked to that land.

If the exploitation of the land earns money, it is added to the value
If the land value varies, it should also be reflected on the token price.

I feel this would be a safe haven in bear markets, plus it could be great for the planet's ecosystem if it's made properly, with a good governance system and sustainability as a core value.

# Question 33: When the majority of peers on the network are malicious and monopolize the network in order to prevent specific nodes from receiving information from honest nodes. 

The correct answer of **Round 32** is...

# Bollinger Bands!

**What are Bollinger Bands:**

The¬†Bollinger Bands, or BB, were developed in the 1980s by financial analyst and trader John Bollinger. Since then, many traders and chartists have been using the BB as a¬†technical analysis (TA) indicator.In essence, the Bollinger Bands function as a measurement tool of market oscillations. As such, the BB indicator can be used to identify the moments that a particular market presents high or low¬†volatility. Also, they can be useful for spotting potential overbought or oversold market conditions.

The BB indicator consists of two sidelong bands and a middle line. These three elements indicate how prices more around an average value, which is represented by the middle band. The upper and lower bands expand when market volatility is high, and contract when market volatility is low. They either move away from the middle band (high volatility) or towards it (low volatility).

The Bollinger Bands are among the most used TA indicators, especially in traditional financial markets. However, they are also used by cryptocurrency traders. Still, BB should not be used as a stand-alone tool but rather in conjunction with other TA tools and indicators, to decrease the overall risks.

There are a few basic ways of reading and interpreting the information provided by the¬†BB indicator.¬†

For instance, imagine that the price of an asset moves from below the middle line all the way up to the upper band, surpassing it. This would indicate a potential overbought condition. The same reading logic applies to the opposite side. If an asset‚Äôs price exceeds the lower band, it may be indicative of oversold conditions. The upper and lower bands may also suggest potential¬†support and¬†resistance levels, in which the price is likely to bounce.

Other than that, the movement of the upper and lower bands in relation to the middle line is a very important factor of the BB indicator. The expansion and contraction of the bands may come handy when traders and chartists are trying to predict the next periods of market volatility (or lack thereof).¬†

For example, if the volatility starts increasing, the bands will expand and move away from the middle line. In contrast, if the market volatility decreases, the bands will contract and move towards the middle.

ridnovir,1635173307," I have been lurking on this board for a while and decided to contribute. I am taking SEC Reg class in law school now and want to share one very illuminating document. As most of you know SEC is the primary regulator of securities in the US and it will decide whether or not particular crypto is a security. Most of you may have heard of the so-called Howey test that SEC will employ to make this determination. However, the analysis that SEC will employ will go much deeper than that and will incorporate numerous important factors.

A body with SEC - the Strategic Hub for Innovation and Financial Technology (FinHub) coordinates the agency‚Äôs oversight and response regarding emerging technologies in financial, regulatory, and supervisory systems ie deals with crypto. FinHub serves as a public resource for information about the SEC‚Äôs views and actions related to FinTech innovation. Here is a link to the paper by FinHub that lays out the analytical framework of how SEC will evaluate if a cryptocurrency project is a security:

 [Here is the Document](https://www.sec.gov/files/dlt-framework.pdf)

I strongly recommend giving it a read and evaluating if your favorite projects could be deemed a security, based on that framework, BEFORE you invest.",CryptoCurrency,Here is how SEC will determine which crypto will be subject to its regulation

&gt; Yes, my friends started the Bureau and I decided to join them on the journey to grow the YouTube channel.

&gt; When it comes to the accusations of trying to ""manipulate your opinion"" or ""shill to the highest bidder"", I won't really dignify that with a response. Perhaps OP didn't see my Tweet from last week:

leo13mg,1635172780,"  Hey guys,  
  Been keeping an eye on BTC lately, have done some analyses on it in the past weeks and now I have identified a different movement happening. This region is losing volume too fast and the players are not changing their position lately, this is dangerous because if a strong enough player acts it can drop the price suddenly! Check the graph:

[BTC has lost 60&amp;#37; of its volume since 21 of October and is back at 63K region, strong pressure region.](https://preview.redd.it/l6uwccdcwlv71.png?width=2557&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=136dc35515f4043d06068e06282852c5cd016021)

  As we can see this is a strong pressure region, acting more as a resistance, and the players are fighting around it. The MACD is stable showing that the buyers are not droping their position and the sellers have not yet attacked heavy the position, except for the 21 of Oct that sent the price back to 60K.

  
  T**he volume is dropping hard last days**, and that is the reason for this analysis, this region is a Pressure Region where big players tend to act heavy and the movements can swing fast, the coin has **lost 60% of its volume** since 21 of Oct and now is prone to Flash Crashes. Any whale can move the price easily now, any news can trigger a heavy movement.

  I have identified the region of 59K as a probably region to be hit by strong swing movements in price, those who are trading can put orders there in hopes to get a lucky movement, specially now that the price has hit 63K again. Its not a conventional trading strategy, more like a lucky shot to get 7% quickly if it happens. We are seeing many news of people getting great prices out off the price reach and is because of this low volume and players holding their region, any strong aggression can drive the price up or down fast. I wound't short this coin but don't FOMO if it hits 67K again, it can be one of these movements, be aware!

  What do you guys think about this region? is BTC getting enough momentum to break 63K for good?

tell me more!

* If you watched Silicon Valley on HBO, NKN is basically a real-life Pied Piper
* If they can accomplish what they're after, it can be HUGE for NKN and the world, essentially allowing users to be their own telecom network
* Similar idea to a Helium network (but again, not a 1:1 comparison)

alexb_090,1635172123,"As every crypto vet knows, the long term price action of crypto, and BTC in particular, has historically been controlled by the BTC halving cycle. For anyone who doesn't know, Bitcoin has a set reward paid out the successful miner of each block. 1 BTC block is mined approximately every 10 minutes. Originally, this reward was 50 BTC. However, every 120k blocks, or about every 4 years, the reward is halved. There have been 3 halvings so far, as can be seen in [this chart](https://masterthecrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/bitcoin-halving-price-usd-exchange-rate-values.jpg). Currently, the block reward is 6.25 BTC.

&amp;#x200B;

The most important thing to note about the chart is that shortly before a halving and then for a long time after, there has consistently been a huge bull market, followed by a bear market, and then a consolidation and accumulation period before the next halving and bull market. Again, every vet should recognize this, but many newbies won't. Although no one is completely sure, these halvings are believed to impact the price of BTC in this way due to the laws of supply and demand. During a halving event, the inflation rate dramatically shrinks and the miners (who presumably own a large percentage of the supply) have a shift in their economic incentives due to the anticipation of smaller supply.

&amp;#x200B;

Now, as you can also see in the chart linked above, each consecutive bull market has been longer and caused a smaller rise in price. This is because each halving has less of an effect on the price. [Here](https://cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/coindesk/VIQLRRLMWZCNXLSAI6AOWE4N4A.png) is a chart showing the total supply and block rewards over time. In the first halving in 2012, with a supply of around 10.5 million BTC, the block reward dropped from 50 to 25 resulting in a daily supply growth change from 7200 BTC to 3600 BTC or a yearly inflation rate drop from 25% to 12.5% overnight. This inflation change is clearly hugely significant. However, the next inflation drop was less significant, from  8.2% to 4.1%, with the most recent one being less significant than that, from 3.5% to 1.75%.

&amp;#x200B;

The lessening impact of these inflation adjustments during halvings combined with the trend of crypto whales being more institutional investors and less miners has been and will continue to lead to the end of BTC cycles. The one we are currently experiencing has already bounced some previous trends with this double peak, and although I am still expecting a dip soon, it will probably be the last clear cycle with an obviously parabolic bull market and a long, cold winter after.

&amp;#x200B;

In terms of what you should take away from this, you should realize that we aren't early anymore. The market is on its way to stabilizing, and although the ordinary American still isn't invested, all the institutions are at least exposed in some way. However, this is still bullish. Stability is attractive and leads to mass adoption, and big gains can still come from new altcoins because although the market is no longer new, much of the tech is. It also means that if/when the next crypto dip comes, it may be your last chance to load up on the big boys at a ""low"" price. I know this has been kind of a wall of text, but I hope it helps someone.",CryptoCurrency,Bitcoin halving cycles and why they mean less and less.

I spoke with my girlfriend and got her interested in the crypto currency world... but she prefers to enter slowly in the market, still on the idea that slow but steady gains are better than ""bets"" on what is rampaing the market in the present moment. She saw the credit card offered by staking coins on [crypto com](https://crypto.com), and the 2% cashback one (the ruby card) seems to be perfect, both for the bonus and the initial price of 350 Euro.  


Problem is I can't find any information about the staking APY on these CRO coins anywhere on the site (and also on the mobile app).   
Saw yesterday someone in a different forum outiside Reddit saying there's a 14% APY of interest, but maybe it's a bit irrealistic... I don't believe it much, and it was a guy alone telling this without other confirmations.

  **2021-09-25** \- LTC/BTC - Added Liquidity            - 1.1065 LTC + 0.0040 BTC - **341.1722 USD**

**TL;DR;** I added to Liquidity Swap in Binance Liquidity swap without properly understanding impermanent loss. Now I have more of low performing coins and less of high performing coins. I am about to remove all funds from liquidity and looking for any advise.

I bought 13 coins assigning a certain amount to each one of them. I picked the coins randomly. Most of them were pumped here in the last bull run. They still existed so I bought them because I was familiar with their name. I didn't do any further research. I know it was not a good strategy but I took the risk.

Here is my calculations and how much my portfolio is worth today.

&amp;#x200B;

|Coin|Quantity|Total Cost (AUD)|Worth Today (AUD)|

|FTM|2736.78|135.78|10948|
|||1300 AUD|14783 AUD|

I remember reading here that buying BTC wouldn't be worth it because someone commented something along the lines of, ""Meh, how much will BTC go up by now, it's already worth so much."" So, I showed less interest in BTC.

If I had spent the entire money (1300 AUD) on Bitcoin, I would have approximately 0.154 BTC which would be worth 12,975 AUD approx today. BTC was around 7K USD and 9K AUD back then.

If I had spent the entire money on ETH I would have 21500 AUD worth of Ethereum.

Had I not exchanged my 33.74 BNB to these Alts, it would be worth **21,854 AUD** today.

I got lucky with the last coin FTM which covered a good portion of my BNB opportunity costs. I bought it by mistake thinking that I was buying Feathercoin about which I heard in a movie.

There were a lot of ups and downs from back then to today. I remember thinking I should have bought a Macbook instead because I had a shitty laptop which I'm using to type this today as well.

Anyways, the lesson I learned was not to invest randomly because you might not always get lucky. Invest in good projects instead.

Background: Shiba Inu is known as the Dogecoin killer and is now seen as the dominant meme coin in the market.

I am overall seeing a fairly positive outlook for crypto in the next few months, but while I think November should be a great month for crypto, I think there is cause for concern for the upcoming winter. I'm not here to spread FUD, just trying to remain level headed and realistic, and that's why I've added in my sources. Please do comment below your opinion on this.

I think before I give a bit of a road map for where I think bitcoin is headed, let's review the current economic situation.

**Inflation:**

Inflation has already been drastically increasing in the west especially with the current limitations of the supply chains, and the quantitative easing due to corona. More money being thrown in, means higher demand, and therefore prices and add on top what is now being termed: ""the great resignation"", where in September alone more that 4.3 Americans resigned from their jobs, you get inflation, leading to companies working understaffed, you get inflation.

**Rising energy prices:**

Energy. Today we are reliant on electricity for everything we do. From mining bitcoin to calling your loved one, to working. However last year's very cold winter, and the COVID pandemic meant that a lot of the energy companies used up their stocks of oil, gas and coal, and most importantly DID NOT REPLENISH THEM THIS PAST YEAR DUE TO LACK OF INVESTMENT UNDER COVID. This means today we are faced with a situation, where with the economy kickstarting back to life, the demand for electricity and energy products in general is soaring but the supply cannot follow. This means higher energy prices, which will not get any better in the winter due to even higher demands. In an other situation, local governments could forcibly cut the electricity at some points during the day or to specific less ""economically valuable"" sectors.

With energy prices soaring, this could lead to a lot of companies first and foremost stopping mining bitcoin because it isn't profitable anymore, or even forcibly being cut off from electricity due to the lack of ""economic value"" that is perceived to be created from bitcoin. This will drop the hash rate, and make processing transactions slower, probably deterring new investors from coming in. Then with the situation of inflation and the energy crisis, well, it will probably lead to households lacking liquidity in the short term until the government can put in place some contractionary policies, and until the winter is over, and thus the demand for energy products lowers. Needing more liquidity, will mean taking money out of investments, crypto will inevitably be included.

&amp;#x200B;

Knowing this, we have to turn to some bitcoin analysis because anyway we know that it will dictate what the asset class does. There are different theories as of now on the direction for bitcoin in the upcoming few months, but the main theory is that the market cycle is not in. Moreover, some analysts have noticed the similarities between the 2013-14 market cycle and the current one. But basically the general consensus seems to be a double peak cycle like the aforementioned one. The key difference in consensus is for example CryptoCrewUniversity  saying the market cycle top could come this upcoming month, and Benjamin Cowen talking about a much longer market cycle that could extend into next year.

\[Bitcoin price prediction - CryptoCrewUniversity\]([https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wECZvQ5twzc&amp;t=3s&amp;ab\_channel=CryptoCrewUniversity](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wECZvQ5twzc&amp;t=3s&amp;ab_channel=CryptoCrewUniversity))

I would like to therefore propose a theory that would take into consideration all of the aforementioned information and merge it into one.

Bitcoin price over the next few months would look something like this:

&amp;#x200B;

[\*\*POTENTIAL\*\* Bitcoin price action in the next 9 months](https://preview.redd.it/lgar0l6lnlv71.png?width=1813&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e62c237ae5990f955dc6bc2957b45aafe97d2f88)

I would like to propose the triple cycle top theory. Let me explain it.

First and foremost, we take from CryptoCrewUniversity's theory that the market cycle top is going to come in in November, however, I will argue that we will get rejected before reaching it by the same bitcoin logarithmic growth band as in April this year (which would then be at 100k, a level which anyway could provide resistance since it is a massive milestone). This would be the second peak. Such a rejection would also be fuelled by the inflation and the energy crisis that is inevitable, and could cause a drop until basically 40k in my opinion. This level would correlate with both the logarithmic band that held as support in July and is the level we held support at in September before we went on the current move to 69k (nice.) . Anyway that would probably mean that in early March the situation might slowly start to clear up with lower demand for energy coming out of the winter and the governments finding solutions to the inflation. We could then finally do another repeat of the move in august to now, with the same move to the middle log band, down to the bull market support band, and then finally the final rally to 150k and above, being the third and final peak, which could correlate then with the longer market cycle theory put forward by Benjamin Cowen.

After researching for a while and not coming up with much projects that are trying to focus on the ecosystem of the food service industry where so many Restaurants have closed, can‚Äôt find any workers and just all the hurdles that this industry is facing in todays time. 
Some of the major outlines of this project will be -
1. Provide donations/charity to local community programs where we can supply food and host pop up kitchens to provide food to the people in need. 
2. Help aspiring cooks, pastry chefs, sommeliers, to get scholarships for ACF certifications and som certifications. 
3. Help burnt out Restaurnt workers by providing them services such as addiction help centers, consulting services, counseling services. 
4. Provide a NFT  platform where stunning dishes are minted into NFT‚Äôs and auctioned. 
5. Help sustainable farming and help get local farms the platform they need to succeed. 
6. Give back to local restaurants(non corporate institutions) 
7. Open canna-cuisine restaurants as the world adapts the concept. 
8. Become a versatile defi  payment solution program for the food service industry 
9. Provide blockchain wise logistic solutions for the food service community.

WorkerBee-3,1635168771,"#The written Constitution itself, along with the Amendments, is the distributed ledger. And Congress, along with the President, is suppose to be the way we all come to consensus. 

How does this work? 

Well in America the 3 branches of government; Legislative, Executive, and Judicial are all supposed to be separated in efforts to point the power towards the people. 

How do the people get power under this constructed system? 

Well, it comes down to how we vote. 

Take political parties out of the equation and follow how the system was written. 

#Article 1: Congress. House of Representatives &amp; the Senate. 

In the constitution each and every State gets their equal representation by having 2 Senetors each as well as a population sized amount of House members. 

Based on general living conditions each state should be electing officials who represent the state's environment. Officials who know what it's like to live in dessert, mountains, the plains, off the ocean, surrounded by lakes, or even swamp/marshy land. And they not only would know what it's like to live in these areas but they should know what laws are best needed for these areas and what laws would hurt those who live in these areas. 

So you get 2 Senetors from each environment and a population sized House members from each environment. Chosen by the people who live in those environments. 

Clear distributed representation from across the entire country. 

#Article 2: The Executive Branch. 

The executive branch, referring to the President and his team of operations, is elected by the country as a whole. All environment landscapes and life styles, city/non-city, vote and the best outcome is suppose to be someone who represents what unifying perspectives are needed across each and every single environment to the best of a full countries abilities to vote. 

If any State feels the President doesn't represent them, well power is split between the branches and they still hold members who represent them in the Legislative Branch which is designed to keep the power of the Executive branch in check. By design, Their Representatives can still tell the President when he's not fulfilling the needs of the full country. 

#Article 3: The Judicial Branch 

How is this branch elected? Well this branch has members who are nominated by the Executive branch (as a country, we pick the person who picks these people) and then those nominations are voted on and approved by the Congress (as individual States, we pick the people who approve these nominations) 

Those who get nominated by the country's thinking (because the president is suppose to represent our thinking as a whole) and then approved by the States thinking (because Congress members are suppose to represent each State's way of thinking) are then in charge of making sure we all follow the rules written up by our voted members of Government. Not only are they in charge of that but they are in charge of reading the Constitution and making sure that the voters/citizens don't have any of their inalienable rights infringed upon during the law making consensus. (Our soul rights of; Life, Liberty, and the Pursuit of Happiness) 

The Judicial branch is designed to keep both the 1st and 2nd branches of government in check so that they don't infringe on the voters rights. They are our final form of protection. 

This is a 200 year old decentralized structure. And this is how consensus was reached before computers.


#This is how the system is designed. 

Political parties are not apart of that original structure and actually compromise the separation between the branches of government. We no longer have 3 separated branches of government because we have both Republicans all across each branch and Democrats all across each branch. 

If you know anything about mining Bitcoin, you would know it is designed in a way that is decentralized. Meaning no one entity controls Bitcoin. It reaches consensus by the globe as a whole. But there is this point of failure called the 51% attack. Because of the price of Bitcoin, the only realistic way for this to happen would be from large mining pools where people join a group to mine and distribute the rewards across the pool when blocks are mined. 

Mining pools = Political Parties (voting pools) 

Political parties are where people join together in big groups to win the seats and then distribute the ""rewards"" (of being able to write laws) across each and every member of that pool. 

The problem with voting pools is they can cause the same 51% attack to the Decentralized Constitution as mining pools can cause to Decentralized Bitcoin. 

Having one pool in all 3 branches of government means there is no longer a separate of power between these branches and that means that the voters no longer have power. The system is compromised. 

The fact that 2 pools are saturated across the 3 branches of Government, and both parties spend a lot of time attacking each other, this country is constantly under a 51% attack. Whichever pool wins majority those years, they have 51%+ control over the consensus and they ""attack"" the other pool instead of voting based off environmental wants and needs like the original design.

Cryptocurrencies are community-driven and open-source. Anyone can innovate upon cryptocurrencies, while comparatively, it is almost impossible for just anyone to innovate upon fiat currencies.

***tl;dr:***

* **What's this all about?** Back in January 2018, I made a homemade crypto Index Fund, purchasing $100 of each of the Top 10. Crypto winter started immediately after, but I haven't sold or traded and have been reporting monthly ever since. I repeated the Experiment 2019, 2020, and 2021 because I'm a glutton for punishment and to show different entry points. ***Learn more about the history and rules of the Experiments (including why in the world I would include Tether)*** [***here***](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/about/)***.***
* **SEP Winner** \- All-red month. Stablecoin **USDT** remained, um, stable, and **DOT** only fell -2%.
* **Overall since Jan. 2021** \- **ADA** in lead followed closely by **BNB. 100%**  of cryptos in green, **LTC** last place in 2021
* **2018+2019+2020+2021 Combined Top Ten Portfolios are returning 405%.**

## Month Nine ‚Äì UP 333%

The 2021 Top Ten Crypto Index Fund consists of:¬†**BTC, ETH, USDT, XRP, Litecoin, DOT, BCH, ADA, BNB,**¬†and¬†**LINK**.¬†¬†

September highlights for the 2021 Top Ten Portfolio:¬†

* Following its first all green month since¬†[February 2021](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2021-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-2), the portfolio finished the month 100% in the red
* **ADA**¬†retains the lead, but second place¬†**BNB**¬†makes up ground in September.

## September Movement Report, Ranking, and Dropouts

Surprisingly, there wasn‚Äôt much movement this month with the 2021 Top Ten:

Downs:

* **Bitcoin Cash**¬†‚Äì down 4 places (#14‚Äì&gt;#18)
* **Chainlink**¬†‚Äì down 3 places (#12‚Äì&gt;#15)

*Processing img ij8g140tilv71...*

**Top Ten dropouts since January 2021:**¬† Nine months into the 2021 Top Ten Experiment, three cryptos have dropped out:¬†**Chainlink, Litecoin,**¬†and¬†**Bitcoin Cash.**¬† They have been replaced by¬†**SOL**,¬†**DOGE,**¬†and¬†**USDC**.

## September Winners and Losers

***September Winners***¬†‚Äì¬† Besides¬†**Tether**,¬†**DOT**¬†had the least bad month, finishing September down only -2%.

***September Losers***¬†‚Äì¬† All coins were in the red, but¬†**ADA**¬†had the worst month, losing -26%.

**Tally of Monthly Winners and Losers**

Nine months into the Experiment, here‚Äôs where we stand in terms of the 2021 Top Ten Portfolio‚Äôs monthly winners and losers: 

*Processing img qqv3fd8uilv71...*

**ADA**¬†is in the lead with three monthly victories.¬†¬†**ADA**¬†is also tied with¬†**UST**¬†for most losses.¬† Swing trade anyone?

## Overall Update ‚Äì ADA in front, BNB in second place, all cryptos in green.

Despite a tough September,¬†**Cardano**¬†has managed to maintain its lead over¬†**Binance Coin**, preventing yet another flip for first place.¬† Both cryptos have had a very strong 2021 up +1,144 and +976% respectively.

The $100 investment into first place¬†**ADA**¬†nine months ago is now worth¬†**$1,243.**

Besides¬†**Tether**,¬†**Litecoin**¬†is the worst performing cryptocurrency of the 2021 Top Ten Portfolio, up only¬†**+29%**¬†in 2021.¬†

## Total Market Cap for the Entire Cryptocurrency Sector:

The total crypto market lost about $108B in September, settling at just over $2.1T.¬† As a sector, crypto is up¬†**+173%**¬†in the nine month lifespan of the 2021 Top Ten Experiment.¬†

You may notice that the 2021 Top Ten Portfolio is returning a little over double the overall crypto market cap (+333% vs. +173%) so far in 2021.¬†¬†

This is a bit of an outlier: the rest of the¬†[Top Ten Experiments](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/)¬†are well behind what the overall market has returned in their respective time frames.¬† Although the 2021 Top Ten approach has held up quite well compared to the overall market so far, I expect to see it fall behind eventually, like the other experiments.

The 2021 Top Ten Portfolio has had the best start, by far, of any of the four¬†[Top Ten Crypto Experiments](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/).¬†¬†

## Combining the 2018, 2019, 2020, and 2021 Top Ten Crypto Portfolios 

As most readers are aware, this is the fourth year of an Experiment I started back in January of 2018,¬†[at the height of the last crypto bull run](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2018-top-ten-month-one/).¬† Where do we stand if we combine four years of the Top Ten Crypto Index Fund Experiments?

* [2018 Top Ten Experiment](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2018-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-45): up +46% (total value $1,460)
* [2019 Top Ten Experiment](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2019-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-33): up +510% (total value $6,098)
* [2020 Top Ten Experiment](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2020-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-21): up +731% (total value $8,309)
* [2021 Top Ten Experiment](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2021-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-9): up +333% (total value $4,330)

Taking the four portfolios together, here‚Äôs the bottom bottom bottom¬†*bottom*¬†line:¬†

**After a $4,000 investment in the 2018, 2019, 2020, and 2021 Top Ten Cryptocurrencies,**¬†the combined portfolios are worth¬†**$20,197**¬†($1,460 + $6,098 + $8,309 + $4,330).

**That‚Äôs up +405%**¬†when you put all four Top Tens together.

Here‚Äôs a table to help visualize the progress of the combined portfolios:

***That‚Äôs a +405% gain by investing $1k into the cryptos that happened to be in the Top Ten on January 1st, 2018, 2019, 2020, and 2021.***

## Comparison to S&amp;P 500

I‚Äôm also tracking the S&amp;P 500 as part of my experiment to have a comparison point to traditional markets. For the first time in nearly a year, the S&amp;P 500 did not reach another month end all time high in September:

*Processing img mz2wxer6jlv71...*

The S&amp;P 500 Index is up¬†**16%**¬†in 2021.¬† The initial $1k investment I put into crypto nine months ago would be worth¬†**$1,160**¬†had it been redirected to the S&amp;P 500.

The 2021 Top Ten Crypto Portfolio is up¬†**+333%**¬†over the same time period ‚Äì the initial $1k investment in crypto nine months ago is now worth¬†**$4,330**.

That‚Äôs a difference of¬†**$3,170**¬†on a $1k investment in nine months.

What about in the longer term? What if I invested in the S&amp;P 500 the same way I did during the first four years of the Top Ten Crypto Index Fund Experiments? What I like to call the world‚Äôs slowest dollar cost averaging method?¬† Here are the figures:

* $1000 investment in S&amp;P 500 on January 1st, 2018 = $1,630 today
* $1000 investment in S&amp;P 500 on January 1st, 2019 = $1,740 today
* $1000 investment in S&amp;P 500 on January 1st, 2020 = $1,350 today
* $1000 investment in S&amp;P 500 on January 1st, 2021 = $1,160 today

Taken together, here‚Äôs the bottom bottom bottom¬†*bottom*¬†line for a similar approach with the S&amp;P:¬†

**After four $1,000 investments into an S&amp;P 500 index fund in January 2018, 2019, 2020, and 2021, my portfolio would be worth $5,880**¬†($1,630 + $1,740 + $1,350 + $1,160)

That‚Äôs up¬†**+47%** [since January 2018](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2018-top-ten-month-one/)¬†compared to a¬†**+405%**¬†gain of the combined Top Ten Crypto Experiment Portfolios, a difference of 358%¬†***in favor of crypto.***

To help provide perspective, here‚Äôs a quick look at the combined four year ROI for crypto vs. the S&amp;P up to this point.

## Conclusion:

The 2021 Top Ten Crypto Portfolio is up¬†**+333%**¬†since the beginning of the year and the only Top Ten Portfolio to outperform the overall market.¬† Q3 is historically a down month for crypto ‚Äì how high can this portfolio reach by the end of the year?

RefugeeDutch_Syrian,1635167688,"The price of 'meme cryptocurrency' shiba inu (SHIB) soared again this weekend. The SHIB price jumped from $0.00002875 on Saturday to a new all-time high (ATH) of $0.00004432 on Sunday. It was an increase of a whopping 54% in 24 hours.

That rise was accompanied by Elon Musk tweeting about dogecoin (DOGE) again. Dogecoin already rose several times this year unprecedentedly hard after Musk's tweets and this time the DOGE and SHIB prices got another boost from Musk. SHIB also rose hard early this month after a tweet from Musk.

However, then the billionaire threw a spanner in the works for SHIB fans. He made it clear last night, around the time the SHIB price peaked, that he is a dogecoin fan and not a shiba inu fan. He denied that he owns SHIB at all:

Then the SHIB price plunged sharply to $0.00003542, down 20%. The huge volume that coincided with SHIB's rise then partially spilled over to dogecoin, which then rose briefly. The Tesla CEO then reported that the only crypto he owns are bitcoin (BTC), ethereum (ETH) and dogecoin:

RefugeeDutch_Syrian,1635167578,"Do you feel you have enough bitcoin? Probably not. In this respect, we normal earthlings are no different from the billionaires of this world.

Entrepreneur, investor and billionaire Peter Thiel indicates to Bloomberg that he should have bought more bitcoin. It's a feeling we all know when bitcoin sets new price records after a relatively weak period.

&amp;#x200B;

Thiel [spoke about bitcoin](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-10-21/thiel-says-he-was-underinvested-in-bitcoin-price-may-rise), central banks and artificial intelligence during an event organized by Lincoln Network in Miami. In particular, the policies of central banks around the world had to take umbrage. ""You should just buy bitcoin alone,"" he joked to the audience in Miami. In which he winked at bitcoin maximalists who generally have their entire wealth in bitcoin.

&amp;#x200B;

**Why did Thiel hesitate to buy more bitcoin?**

***The only thing Peter Thiel currently seems to regret is not buying more bitcoin earlier***. ""I feel like I haven't invested enough in bitcoin,"" the billionaire said. The reason he did not invest more is because he had the belief that ""the secret"" was already known to everyone. By which he means that he thought everyone with a little money had long understood bitcoin.

&amp;#x200B;

The current price explosion proves otherwise and Peter Thiel sees that too. ""I think more buying is still the best strategy. Maybe it's still enough of a secret,"" Thiel continued. The co-founder of PayPal seems almost unable to believe that not everyone has already figured out the value of bitcoin in the current macroeconomic climate.

&amp;#x200B;

Known as a libertarian, Thiel sees the rise of bitcoin as the world's answer to the current financial system that is squeaking and creaking on all sides. ""Is bitcoin going to rise beyond $66,000? It could, but it certainly shows that it we've arrived at the complete bankruptcy of central banks,"" Thiel reveals in no uncertain terms.",CryptoCurrency,"German-American billionaire, Peter Thiel, regrets not buying more bitcoin earlier, he is one of us"
Expert_Opening543,1635167565,"I threw a small amount of money at crypto in 2018 and didn't do anything else until last year. Then I started putting  small chunks of money in whenever I felt like it. In 2021 I started DCA every week so im finally getting excited and watching it climb.

I see people talk about if you put 1000 into bitcoij 10 years ago you would have 15 million ( or whatever it is now). But the point in making , or asking rather , is do you have a specific strategy to sell? I find it hard to believe that the people that started very early didn't sell WAY earlier than they would of liked. Because BTC at 5000 seemed crazy, they probably would of never believed 50,000. 

I obviously don't plan on holding forever because what's the point of investing all of this if you don't get to enjoy it but do you sell a certain percentage when the market goes up or down say 10 percent? 

I started DCA because I found that I wasn't disciplined enough to try to time the market. Too many doubts on if this was the bottom or top.

belsaurn,1635167501,"I keep seeing people talk about if this happens or that happens regulation wise, that people would just put their profits into XMR or another privacy coin, or ""lose"" it in a boating accident to avoid taxes or regulations on it.

I would really like to know how you think that would avoid the government knowing about it or trying to tax you on it, and what good it would actually do you?

Lets say for example you moved all your crypto to XMR to avoid taxes on it. How would that hide it? You had to buy it some way, whether that is through an exchange, a dex or P2P, there would be a trail right up to you receiving the XMR. Sure they can't tell what you did with it after, but they would know you have it.

Now the boating accident situation, would losing your crypto make it be forgiven by the tax man? I know if you keep cash and your house burns down, you are still liable for the taxes you owe earning that cash no matter that it burnt. So how would ""losing"" it in a boating accident be any different?

Lastly, lets say you did manage to conceal it in XMR or convince the tax man you shouldn't pay tax on crypto you lost. What could you do with it then? If you want to spend it right now, you would have to be able to convert it to fiat at some point, meaning it would once again be traceable. So how would that actually work?",CryptoCurrency,"Taxes, XMR and Boating Accidents"

undevy,1635166941,"&gt;**TL;DR**: It‚Äôs really fun to make money. But, you know what‚Äôs even more fun? Using crypto profits to take care of your mental health and well-being. Doing this will make you a better person for yourself, your family, and everyone you meet.

Since so many all-time highs have been reached lately, and a lot of our portfolios are in green, it is important to recognize that we are in a bull market at this point. **It won't last forever**, and it may not even last till the end of the year, so it is an interesting exercise to think about where all this is going.

Putting this post together is about how to step back from crypto psychologically. There isn't the best moment to do so, but **exiting with profits could be the most important step of your life**. Speaking from my own experience, by no means do I intend to give financial advice.

If you've been in this sub for a long time now, you can feel the greed and euphoria of every single market rise. The topic of taking your profits and DCA out has been discussed a lot recently. However, **we don't tackle enough the subject of what we should do next** when the profits aren't on paper but in our bank accounts.

Because the crypto market can go up and down in an instant, when you're in the green, it is important to appreciate that you reach your goals on time. We all know the HODL mantra, and having a lot of crypto in your portfolio is still a smart move, but you should also take advantage of bull markets to do good in the world.

**Are you really going to look at the charts every day until you die?** Cryptocurrencies should not become a source of dopamine for you. The world is a beautiful place, and you no doubt have a place in it. Remember that crypto is not our ultimate goal, and if we haven't learned by now, crypto won't make us happy. **If you look at your life after you've made a lot of money, it's easy to see that you're still the same person.** If you're happy, you're happy; if you're unhappy, you're unhappy. If you're only in it for the money, likely, you won't find any meaning or fulfillment.

Think about what you want in life, and do not focus on ""getting rich fast"", **focus on your deepest desires**. Use your profit as a tool to improve your life, by traveling, buying a new house, starting a business, paying off debt, or just enjoying life. The list of things that will bring genuine happiness is endless. Having never been happy in my life, I always assumed the reason was lack of money, but I realized that good profits could solve my money problems, but they definitely don't solve all my problems.

To be genuinely happy, I had to take responsibility for my mental health. I used some of my profits to focus on it and started feeling exponentially better. To be genuinely happy used to seem impossible to me, but boy, I have never been so wrong in my life! I am now happier than ever, and it feels incredible.

**Self-improvement is the most effective way to make the world a better place.** You don't have to be a narcissistic asshole, all you need to do is practice self-care and care for the people around you. You should never forget that the profits from selling parts of your crypto portfolio may help you live the life you really want.",CryptoCurrency,Crypto won‚Äôt make you happy. It never could.

Lexikov,1635166247,"Have any of you heard or invested in FEG yet?

Looks quite promising as a project, with good fundamentals and a bright roadmap ahead. It‚Äôs one of those hyper deflation tokens that looks much more promising than the other ones available. 

Would love to open a discussion with some of you regarding this. 

The main idea behind FEG Token is to provide a decentralized transaction network, which operates on the Ethereum blockchain (ERC-20) and the Binance Smart Chain (BEP-20). The path forward for FEG Token is determined by market fluctuations, but the model it runs on begs FEG Token to succeed.
FEG Token is a hyper-deflationary token with a maximum circulating supply of 100Q (quadrillion) on both the Ethereum blockchain and the Binance Smart Chain that involves an inaccessible burn wallet. Depending on each holder‚Äôs percentage of ownership, a 2% transaction tax is distributed among all holders‚Äîthis includes the burn wallet, which is essentially a holder that collects more tokens over time as transactions occur. As the circulating supply decreases, the scarcity of the token increases. This inversely proportional relationship constitutes a supply and demand model. There is no limit as to how many tokens can be burnt. Without a burning limit, holders get to enjoy a never-ending cycle of passive income with positive price pressure!

Immediately I said I don't know as it was my flat mate that paid but I gave an educated guess and she said it will take 24 hours to reflect. Secondly, she said because it wasn't instantaneous it might also be the reason why my power isn't on.

My first though after this conversation was, that if I were to send my flat mate some BTC and they had a Binance account, I could use any supported network. Original BTC, wrapped BTC on ERC20 or even BEP20 or BEP2. Either way, they would have received the payment as long as they gave me the network of choice's address. Thus, I could pay them almost instantly using any network and the fees and speed would be my choice. 

So are you telling me there are banks in Switzerland older than 100 years and all of the banks in my country have existed for more than 50 years and this surperior payment system cannot communicate between banks? So I have banking fees because my bank has a dedicated team of developers working on a glorified SQL server which cannot communicate with others?

Secondly, there exists a special payment for me to send funds to other banks?

So you are telling me, interoperability between blockchains is own of the essential features we all on this sub want, but my bank can't even do that? And if I want interoperability I need to pay an extra fee for my bank account to talk to another.

Finally, why do I even need this company and 2 different banks? Why can't my meter have a wallet of its own or be some kind of IOT device using something like Nano or IOTA or even BTC or ETH, where I deposit the funds directly into the device? Why do I need to send a payment from one bank, to another and then some desk jockey makes changes on a SQL server to reflect my payment?

This entire situation is just so frustrating. My payment is somewhere in limbo and I am sitting without electricity because the current surperior payment system doesn't offer interoperability unless I essentially pay a fine for having the fucking audacity to move funds out of my bank account. 

TLDR: We need decentralization and current blockchains employ better interoperability than the traditional financial system.",CryptoCurrency,A story: my experience with a bank en centralised entity and why we need decentralization

mmmmhmm88,1635165613,"After my previous post about the asset allocation for my retirement savings. My future 65 year old self decided I'm too exposed to crypto right now.

I'm sure this is common knowledge to most of you here, but when researching various other assets - stocks, metals, ETFs etc, I was pleasantly surprised to see a number of coins with market caps rivalling some of the worlds biggest companies, not to mention keeping up and exceeding market caps of almost all precious metals. Except the big two!

Let's hope this post ages poorly, for all the right reasons. 

# The takeaway - BTC

* There are only 5 companies in the world with a bigger market cap than Bitcoin. That is, Saudi Aramco and the 4 tech giants (Apple, Microsoft, Google and Amazon).
* There are only two metals with a bigger market cap than Bitcoin. Silver and Gold.
* That puts Bitcoin at #8 on the list.

# Some more takeaway - ETH

* Perhaps more surprising to me was Ethereum, making it to #17 on this list.
* Etherum has bigger market cap than some massive multinationals. Johnson &amp; Johnson, Samsung and MasterCard to name a few.

# The challengers

* BTC needs to increase by approximately 15% to 72.8K USD to overtake silver
* BTC needs to increate by approximately 42% to 89K USD to overtake Amazon
* The bulls on here would have you believe both of those are doable by the end of 2021. IMO overtaking silver this year is all but inevitable, Amazon may be a tougher nut to crack.

# The leader board

|**Rank**|Asset|Market Cap (Trillion USD)|
|:-|:-|:-|
|1|Gold|11.454 |
|2|Apple|2.457|

I am an ardent fan and user of CRO token. I had this question that the CRO token is more like a stable coin, its price doesn't rise up as fast.

Is there any obvious risks I'm missing or does it look like a good deal?",CryptoCurrency,"Getting 12%+ apy staking Stablecoins, any obvious risks I'm missing?"
anon_ghost_123,1635161005,"Hi guys,

I'd like to know the best place to invest my salary, and make stable passive returns.

I'm good on the programming side (I'm a Smart Contract Dev for a DAO), but I'm a finance noob.

I'm not interested in more complex stuff (like Leverage Trading). I know my limitations and won't get into anything I don't understand.

I'm also not interested in methods that require a lot of work (constantly checking prices and whatnot). I want it to be as passive as possible. Invest and forget.

I saw these:

* [https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/pitnji/using\_cryptos\_to\_earn\_passive\_income\_my/](https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/pitnji/using_cryptos_to_earn_passive_income_my/)
* [https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/lk2rtw/the\_ultimate\_guide\_to\_earning\_passive\_income\_with/](https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/lk2rtw/the_ultimate_guide_to_earning_passive_income_with/)

But instead of comparing the overall methods, I want to get more specific (protocols and trading pairs).

From what I've seen, the main candidates are:

* Anchor Protocol (\~20% APY, decentralized)
* Lending USDT (\~30% APY, centralized)
* Staking
* Providing Liquidity for Dexes

A few questions:

1. Rates of 20% and 30% seem to good to be true. Are these rates untrusworthy? Or is my perception skewed due to the crappy rates offered by banks?
2. Comparing KuCoin USDT Lending and Anchor Protocol:
   1. How would you compare security between them? While Anchor is decentralized, Kucoin is not. How trustworthy is Kucoin USDT lending?
   2. I have my doubts around USDT. I prefer either algorithmic stablecoins (like DAI or UST) or USDC because at least is backed by something. Is using USDT even a good idea?
   3. Lending USDT on Kucoin has higher returns than Anchor because it compounds daily, right? If so, are any there other suitable candidates with daily compounding?
3. If I was to provide liquidity for a Dex, would providing liquidity for a stablecoin pair (USDC/DAI or USDC/USDT) remove the risk of impermanent loss?
4. Staking seems simple, but I have some doubts regarding PoS. Aren't the staking rewards basically causing inflation? Yeah, a coin might have 50% staking rewards, but wouldn't its price just eventually drop, making the staking itself pointless?
5. I'd like to use this passive income for a living. Do I have to keep all of my funds locked in these protocols? Or can I keep the initial investment locked, but make monthly withdrawals of the returns? Maybe I can even withdraw any amount I want?

Any other suggestions?

Thanks :)",CryptoCurrency,What is the best source of stable passive income in Crypto?

sylsau,1635158977,"You're interested in Bitcoin, but you're afraid to jump into this new world. What's stopping you? Mainly, the fear of losing money. After all, the powerful people at the head of the current system keep telling you that Bitcoin is dangerous because it is too volatile.

The main reason they talk about Bitcoin is so that you don't do your own research and realize that Bitcoin's volatility will only impact you in the short term. If you buy Bitcoin with a long-term view, then this volatility will no longer be an issue.

Furthermore, not taking action with Bitcoin is exactly what makes you lose money.

Indeed, while you are hesitating, your purchasing power in US dollars is being eaten away by inflation which has been above 5% for several months in America. Contrary to what Jerome Powell tried to make you believe, the situation will not be transitory. This inflation will persist and it is up to you to take care of your future regarding money.

Once you understand that you need to invest, you will ask yourself the question of which markets to go into.

If you take a quick look, you'll see that the real estate market is already overheating in the middle of a bubble. The stock market is moving at record levels, but that's not likely to last forever. Commodities have risen sharply in 2021, and a correction is expected in 2022.

Inflation-linked bonds may be an option given the very high inflation we have to deal with, but I am not a fan of this kind of product.

Gold may be an option, but the precious metal has been struggling to convince since the summer of 2020 when the price per ounce exceeded $2,000. Gold is underperforming while we are in the midst of great monetary inflation. This is a signal that something is changing. Gold is slowly but surely leaving the hearts of investors.

If gold is leaving the hearts of investors, it is primarily because another store of value has been emerging for several years. This is Bitcoin, which has proven since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic that it can act as a safe haven in times of crisis.

Since the beginning of the pandemic, the price of Bitcoin has increased tenfold. More and more investors see Bitcoin as a digital version of gold. Of course, Bitcoin allows for much more than that, but as it stands, that's how many investors view the digital currency invented by Satoshi Nakamoto.

Bitcoin also has the advantage of being perfectly suited to tomorrow's world where everything will become digital. Future generations will see Bitcoin as normalcy, while gold will be seen as something impractical and outdated.

So taking action with Bitcoin is a way to keep up with the world while protecting the fruits of your labor from the inflation that will continue to wreak havoc in the months and years to come.",CryptoCurrency,For those who are still hesitating to take action - Why buying Bitcoin is a no-brainer when inflation will continue to hurt your wealth in the months and years to come
ragnarokfps,1635158868,"I've been a gamer since 1997, I also like my crypto. For those of you who like crypto (particularly NFT's), but aren't gamers, here's a friendly bit of advice. Don't hold your breath for NFT gaming to happen. It will never happen, and here's why. It's pretty simple, really. Gamers fucking *hate* microtransactions. Period, full stop. But to explain how this came to be, you have to understand what video games are, and why people play them. Once you understand that, you will know why NFT's don't mix with video games. 

On May 15, 2012, the long awaited Diablo 3 game came out. This is one of the most popular and well-known video game franchises in the world, with it's successor having released 12 years earlier in 2000. Diablo fans had been waiting for this game a very long time. This game came out in 2012 with an in-game auction house, where players could buy and sell their gear for fake in-game gold, or real life hard currency, those greenbacks. This completely destroyed the game, and made national news headlines at least in the US. The game's developer and publisher were publicly flamed mercilessly on the internet by Diablo players until the developers decided to remove the auction from the game. This was such an outrage to gamers that this fiasco transcended the Diablo universe and enraged players had never even played a Diablo game. The backlash against this had never been seen before, or since. That was a painful lesson for Diablo's developers and publisher, and was more or less the equivalent of a public execution in the town square for what's now commonly known today as microtransactions in video games. 

Sinfe then, every time a game developer put microtransactions in their video games, they were publicly humiliated by the gamers that play those games, with countless lawsuits and even federal laws and regulations being put in place to prevent certain kinds of microtransactions. This is all public knowledge at this point, 9 years later, so you can PreSearch microtransactions in video games or Diablo 3 auction house to your heart's content.

For your own sake, I don't recommend investing in gaming NFT's. There's a long and bitter history of microtransactions in video games, and if that shit fiat currency can't even make it work, NFT's aren't going to fare any better.

I've made a new educational video that will teach you how to analyze wallets, contracts, and blockchain transactions on BSCScan (Same as EtherScan and PolyScan, etc..).

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x61IVwXfXNI](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x61IVwXfXNI)

We will learn how to read transactions, how to track wallets, contracts and monitor the flow of the money and the tokens on the Binance Smart Chain network.

 We will also learn how to track our own wallets and see what kind of tokens we have and what transactions we send and receive.

Working with blockchain trackers like BSCScan, EtherScan, PolygonScan, etc, is very important and if you know how to read transactions and track wallets and smart contracts, your level of understanding in Crypto and DEFI will be much higher.

You will be able to understand your assets, investments, your trades, and the functions that you call in smart contracts, instead of being a noob who is just clicking buttons and doesn't understand what it does in the backend.

Also, tracking the blockchain using websites like BSCScan, you can find good trading and investments opportunities by tracking relevant interesting wallets.

This guide should cover and give very good fundamentals in order to start monitoring and tracking DEFI and blockchains.

Memecoins are making massive price rally‚Äôs and are quickly picked up in cryptospaces, like this one, and everyone is talking about them more and more which seems to reflect on the Price. 
For example when Elon musk mentioned Dogecoin the price literally exploded.

So I was wondering how did BTC start? I mean it was a revolutionary idea that was also picked up by many, but was it because of its utility as store of value, or more because hipsters and tech geeks and others hyped it up? It doesn‚Äôt seem to me like a memecoin but it‚Äôs price is raising too.

I‚Äôve seen some people say this is just how the market is working at the moment, utility is being forgotten and only hype and memes are important. But if so, for how long? I would be depressingly frustrated if projects with GREAT utility die because the market favors memecoins.

SpaceFaceMistake,1635154364,"TLDR: What study units or courses should I learn formal or informal to gain better understanding in finances with end goal of managing my own crypto and or other exchanged positions?

To start here is some basic info on my finacial and crypto history. 

I have a small amount of crypto of which has been earned from learning, referring or from legitimate giveaways or tips. I don‚Äôt own any other stocks or shares. I understand income tax and capital gains tax. I understand how crypto works more than I do for fiat and or business stocks. I am yet to put any of my own money into any market on the stock exchange.

Within the 18 months I‚Äôve been following and learning about cryptocurrency I‚Äôve learned the basics. I know how to store and securely access and transact crypto being on the chain not on a wallet as I, like many assumed to start with. I know the main terms in the crypto space and some terms within finances. I can make some sense of charts and some indicators that are easily read but I don‚Äôt have any in-depth charting knowledge or know how. I have always been good with math/numeracy over english/literacy.

I don‚Äôt plan on trading but I may end up trading. I am more interested for now on how to invest and invest well. I mean unless there is a good reason I should learn to trade first before learning to invest? 

Basically I just feel like I need to do some proper study that leads to experience though work placement. With the study leading to understanding and then to comfortably investing on my own. Like for anything non-crypto it would be way smarter and safer to use a broker as their knowledge outweighs mine 10 fold.

To me the same applies to crypto but there aren‚Äôt personal brokers for it except for the very new ETFs. It‚Äôs that those that understand finacial markets before or while crypto has been around, they will be able to understand the crypto markets a whole lot better than any crypto enthusiast or follower or owner. Unless those followers or owners were or are finacial brokers or have learned finacial systems and that of what a broker would learn and the experience from holding a job in finance or stock broking.

Ideally I need a course or field of study long and or short that would help open my eyes to how finances, economy and the stock market works. I mean I‚Äôve been told to learn accounting but I still don‚Äôt know if that would be ideal or if another field of study would be better suited to the study of finacial markets leading to having a greater understanding in finance to be able to make decisions on my own with regard to crypto and other markets positions.

Monster_Chief17,1635153997,"ICOs are back and this time they are disguised as ""gaming tokens"". Just like all of them flopped, NFT gaming will probably have to suffer a similar fate. Here are a few reasons why I think that:


* Getting started with NFT games can cost a few thousand. And this is just to **get started**. They all boast about a play-to-earn model but no one is telling you that you need $3k to actually have a chance to earn. There are very few people that actually have that kind of money to throw into the fire so there is very little chance any of these games manage to acquire a decent player base.


* Most of these games aren't even games. They are just roadmaps and promise that you will get a game but you need to wait.  ICO survivors still have PTSD from *Soon‚Ñ¢*.


* Commenting NFT gaming on Ethereum is pointless at this point. It's like paying $50 to make one move in a game of chess that you are trying to play for fun.


* Lastly, most ""games"" I found that are actually playable on cheaper blockchains like Wax or Fantom are either simple clicking games or very shitty ones made in Unity.



I can give props to Gods Unchained and a handful of others but it is really not looking good so far. Crypto marketing is pushing the Metaverse narrative but if you actually use blockchains you know that there is still no Metaverse out there.

reaglesham,1635150661,"And so my journey begins. As a not-very-wealthy dude who‚Äôs employment was sideswiped by COVID and is yet to fully recover, its tough to keep DCA going for my small crypto investments. Because I believe in crypto, I started small, making tiny savings here and there, and over time my philosophy has changed. When you don‚Äôt have much to work with and you try to invest, you look at that beer, sandwich or new videogame and think ‚Äúdo I really need this?‚Äù. I started re-evaluating my expenses - do they actually make me happy?

Around the same time, my fitness began to wane and I realised how much money I was spending on alcohol, junk food and unhealthy snacks. Fitness is a big deal for me, so I decided to get back on that horse - working out and eating the classic diet of chicken, rice and broccoli. As I work to improve my health, I feel better about myself. Sure, the junk food tastes good, but the effect it has on my fitness was detrimental to my mood in the long run. Is the momentary bliss of a cheeseburger worth the long-term hit to my self-esteem (and arteries)? When I‚Äôm in good health, I‚Äôm in a good mood, so it‚Äôs best to cut out those expensive, unhealthy purchases in favour of a more humble diet - plus it leaves me more for crypto.

Videogames, streaming services and movies bring me a lot of enjoyment, but I‚Äôm sitting on a backlog of games I‚Äôve never played, movies I‚Äôve never watched and streaming services I don‚Äôt often use. Why chase the next new game when 2018‚Äôs back catalogue is still barely played? Cutting these, I either value the purchases I‚Äôve made more, or decide to spend my time doing other, potentially more fulfilling things. It‚Äôs a win-win - plus it leaves me more for crypto.

The tenets of the crypto monk began to emerge:

* **Do not chase fleeting happiness** as it will quickly fade. Find joy in the experiences that you cherish, and explore the experiences you have undervalued until now.
* **What strengthens the body emboldens the mind** and with health comes happiness.
* **If you truly see value in something, it is worth the expense** \- the life of the crypto monk is about living well and valuing your life, not reducing your enjoyment of life to chase financial gain. If you believe a purchase will improve your life, do it. If it falls short, you‚Äôll know more about yourself and what you value for next time.
* **Invest what you save into your future**. May your financial security bring you peace in the years to come.
* **Don‚Äôt chase pumps.** This way lies destruction.

From now on I hope to value what I have, and enrich my life rather than filling it with frivolous purchases. My health will improve, my mental health along with it, and all of this will leave me more money to invest in crypto projects I believe in - hopefully reducing the financial turmoil of my future.

Mettez,1635149935,"I'm not sure what exact emotion it triggers within me, but a part of me truly feels happy and giddy every time I see MSM talking about so called 'memecoins'. I'm not personally invested in them, my heart can't take it. I was lucky enough to have a lucky 200% gain on Doge a while back before I pulled out, and I didn't dare putting any money in Shiba. Nevertheless, it never feels like I'm 'left out', instead it really triggers my funny bone every time these coins are mentioned by the 'classier' news outlets.

I really think we (as in, people active on r/cc) severely underestimate (or underestimated perhaps) the strength and place 'memecoins' have in the crypto market. I understand that tokenomics are important, and that a lot of people might/will be rug pulled, but we cannot deny that memecoins are a great way to attract new people to the space. Let me rephrase:

People unfamiliar with investing/crypto usually don't care about jargon like APR, APY, staking, impermanence loss, market cap, etc. So, they aren't 'attracted' to the same information that we care about, as we now have been in the space for at least some time. Using myself as a practical example, dogecoin is what got me initially interested in crypto. Call it, a gateway crypto. Because of me wanting to own some (not caring about making a lot of money just yet, only putting in x euros), I made my first account on an exchange. That lead me to checking out other crypto names, and seeing those few euros turn into a few more, drove me to reading about actually investing in crypto. I made my first wallet(s), got a bit more informed, and now I'm actually investing a relatively large part of my liquid net value in crypto. I'm no longer into memecoins, but not because I don't think they matter, I'm just not willing to take part in the risk involved.

However, I think that some people forget how they started out, or that not everyone is aware of how investing works and what to watch out for when they are younger. Add the complexity of the crypto space as a whole to it, and all of a sudden, funny dog currencies as a meme seem extremely plausible! You know, in a very weird way, meme's were the original 'decentralized' internet interactions. Nobody 'bought' a meme, or could pay for one, the collective decided what meme's grew or became popular, almost like how funny dog coins are behaving now.. ü§î",CryptoCurrency,It honestly makes me happy to see regular media outlets reporting on the rising 'memecoin' phenomenon

Mr_bike,1635147033,"I teach in East Asia and I was expecting students to be asking me if I own any bitcoin or crypto last week or this week. My lesson topic this week for second years is 'technology and the future', so this just lined up pretty well (my curriculum was made weeks before the semester started). My first semester here and I have students asking if I own stocks, I tell them, no, but they don't ask about crypto. They know about Doge though, for sure. I brought up SpaceX today and students refer to Elon as that, 'Doge guy'. So they see those memes. In the libraries I see books about blockchain and skimming through it, it is certainly about the tech.

Here they are pretty crazy about crypto as well. I have a couple of friends here that admittedly are just gambling on ripple winning a lawsuit and making a breakthrough and have no idea the tech behind any of this. It's admittedly a problem for some because they will spend their workday trying to day trade shitcoins like doge, get recktd and lose their job.

I guess where I'm going with this is, I thought BTC breaking an ATH meant that everyone would be talking about it because crypto was mainstream and cool now. Nah, I guess this is still just magic internet money and it won't be on more people's minds until it is all making 50%&lt; gains in a week.

I was hoping when I was doing a word wall about technology this week some students would say bitcoin or blockchain, so far I am disappointed. A couple of weeks ago I used AI pics as a warmup and how deepfakes could be dangerous for news in the future. With the news of Associated Press opening a node on LINK, I've just been jumping at the bit to reference that in class. How blockchain can fight misinformation. Maybe it is just my students but it only seems like I have only two student out of 420ish (I'm not memeing on that either) interested in blockchain.

I guess I will have to give it another month when BTC is hitting crazy levels for students to be trying to talk to me about it. If they ask, I'm just gonna say that it is interesting technology but I can't invest because I am a foreigner and the bank won't let me buy it.

I‚Äôm seeing a bright future with these next few months. And with altcoin season approaching, now is a great time to stake and loan! Right now, I absolutely love staking. The interest rates are astronomically higher than those offered by fiat savings accounts.

Right now, I'm staking my **Tezos** and **Cardano** using **Ledger**, and also did some lending on [**Celsius**](https://celsius.network/), [**Haru Invest**](https://haruinvest.com/), and Nexo because their yields have much higher percentages (also risky lol), so I diversified with both staking and lending instead to get the best of both because the compounding will add up quite a bit over the coming year(s) (Hopefully).

After challenging all you 'experts' to answer the question posed in a mature and thoughtful way and getting pelted with the usual juvenile trash that is the hallmark of soft-bellied, bespectacled Dungeons &amp; Dragons-esque  nebbishes that are resident on all  internet forums everywhere,  I was able to  sort  through the wild-eyed raving,  name-calling and the bizarre theories on dismantling the global financial system and rebuilding it in some whacky hodge-podge of cartoon character ""NFT's"" and then sift out the coherent responses of  the mature and rational 1% 

 Based on that and greatly condensing the very same,  I have come up with just a few, more tangible and reality-based reasons to buy crypto *in addition to* real  world assets like stock and real estate.

Here are the top three:

1) **To make a profit**, regardless of politics, rebelling against your parents or childish 'virtue signaling' 

2) The action buzz

3) It runs 24/7 like a casino

Pursuant to the above captioned incentives, and so as not to miss out on potential drug-dealer style profiteering, I have made the leap into crypto trading.  I'm sure there are more lofty-sounding, contrived and excessively wordy narratives. But my goal is to make money, not change the world. 

I just want all of the crypto purists to admit they are just as greedy as I am and that dressing up a dice game as investing does not alter the truth.

Prestigious-Low-8942,1635145138,"I read dozens of times how important the usability of a blockchain for the coin is. 

I even read about people being happy that they sold their ""shitcoins"" to buy ""real projects"" like ada, dot or terra. And people commenting that this is wise and everybody should do that. 

I trade for several years now with coins and regardless that i made the mode out of eth and btc, i have to say, that this ""real project"" stuff is bullshit. 

&amp;#x200B;

Why? This is really easy to explain: 

Did you ever integrate some of those ""real projects"" into your project? pretty surely not. Do you have a friend who did? Pretty surely not. They might have a useability (e.g. brave token/bat and filecoin) but nobody really uses it (for now).

&amp;#x200B;

Bitcoin

The most potential use use case of a coin is the transaction method. And every coin is providing this. Bitcoin is the most preferrable, because it is well known on the black market for long. 

&amp;#x200B;

To Summarize: 

The projects might have a future, but for today:   
A filecoin has as much usability as a shiba inu coin. They are just not used today.   
So why should a whale put his money into a coin (and drop it after everybody gets fomo'd and buys) which has a great market cap? This is far more expensive than buying and dropping a cheap coin.

I've seen a few social media posts from people just learning about NFTs getting frustrated that some of the different collections take research to figure out first, before being able to make an informed purchase. This illustration is meant to serve as a reminder that many NFTs can be thought of as ""collectibles"" (in addition to ""fine art"", ""game assets"" or other ""utility"" aspects), and for most collecting hobbies in the non-digital world, there's a connotation that some research is needed to start that ""hobby"", and that's okay.

In that photo are a few items that might have intrinsic worth to a collector. Most adults will know that there are some people who collect coins, and some old coins are worth a lot of money, even if they themselves don't collect coins. Same with trading cards; even if you don't want to own trading cards to play a game with them, seeing a trading card in a hard plastic sleeve gives a hint that the owner thought it valuable enough to give it another layer of protection, so maybe it's most valuable, since the coin doesn't have a protective case? That device pictured looks like a smartphone; it might be fairly valuable, if it's a recent model? Even for someone who's not extremely tech-savvy, they'd be able to guess it's not *decades* old, since they didn't make smartphones back then.

My point is that it would likely take someone at least a few hours research to determine the worth of these things, if they weren't a collector already. When approaching NFT projects that aren't just ""fine art"" pieces, we haven't yet reached a level of public awareness of what ""hints"" a casual observer can recognize as cues (like the hard case protecting a trading card a lot of adults would recognize as interpret as a clue of value), and so it takes a bit more research to become aware what the nuances of each collection are. So, I guess this is partly a fun exercise in comparing physical to digital collectibles, and partly my plea/reminder to be helpful to newcomers as they try and gain those ""reflexes"" for what to look for, and if you are a newcomer, to realize this is a new ""skill"" and so it's okay if it takes at least a little bit of work to understand, and not to feel discouraged if it doesn't ""click"" right away.

So, back to my original question in the title: that is an NFT shown on the screen of that device (it's ""MoonCat #1289""). What's your opinion; is it the most valuable thing pictured, or something else?",CryptoCurrency,What's the most valuable thing in this picture?

Token offerings (sometimes called Initial Coin Offerings, or ICOs) are a way for crypto projects to raise funding and an opportunity for investors to make money by buying new project tokens before their prices rise on the market. 

While many token offerings were legitimate, and many projects failed because of simple business or economic reasons, scams involving token offerings were¬†widespread from 2014 onwards as scammers took advantage of the crypto hype, a lack of awareness of how¬†crypto worked, and human flaws like greed and fear. 

Token offering scams have fallen significantly after Huobi launched its Huobi Prime token offering platform in 2017. This is also due in part to better public education about how cryptocurrencies work, but also because of the simplified and verified process that Huobi Prime uses to evaluate new projects before allowing them on our platform. 

Even though investors on the Huobi Prime platform can rest easy, many scams still happen outside of Huobi‚Äôs ecosystem and a savvy investor must¬†learn¬†how to identify and avoid them. 

Here are some of the¬†most¬†popular scams¬†committed as a token¬†offering: 

 

# The Exit Scam 

The exit scam happens when an insider raises funds for the project and subsequently closes or exits the project with raised funds. This leaves the investor with a bag of tokens with no inherent value.¬† 

This can either happen with a token project or an exchange that is raising funds. Like in the case of Thodex, where the founder, Ozer, disappeared with investors' funds. 

# Airdrop Scam 

Airdrop refers to free tokens given to investors in exchange for adoption of a new platform, purchase of new tokens, or locking in of tokens. 

A project will usually allocate a portion of the token supply to be distributed to investors, by doing so, it allows the token project owners to gather a mass audience with the pretense of giving out free cryptocurrency. 

The scam works by getting parties interested in the airdrop to submit personal information, private keys or purchasing tokens to receive more airdrops. The interested parties may get the airdropped tokens, but these tokens might not have value or very little value as compared to the information that the scammers have obtained. 

The OmiseGo airdrop scam is one of the largest scams in the history of crypto. OmiseGo (OMG) was supposed to be airdropped in September 2017, but it got postponed. Scammers took this opportunity, creating fake Twitter handles, Telegram chat groups, fake Forums threads and sites, tricking unsuspecting users into submitting their private keys. It was reported that more than 300 Ether were lost to scammers. 

# Phishing Scams 

Even today, phishing scam is one that many investors fall for. Scammers disguise as legit entities or a trusted source deceives the victim into thinking that his or her account is getting hacked. Which subsequently, the victim will be brought to a fake site that resembles the legit entity. The victim is then prompted to change sensitive information like passwords and 2FA, of which, the scammer can access the victim‚Äôs account to perform malicious transactions. 

It is reported that such scams have¬†[rose more than 1000%](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/bitcoin-cryptocurrency-investment-scams/)¬†and cost investors almost $80 million dollars. 

# Pump and Dump 

During a token offering or token sale, investors exchange their cryptocurrencies for the new token. The project owner or team will share in their whitepaper how many tokens will be released for sale, set aside for future development and so on. 

 üì∑Figure 1:Axie Infinity Token Breakdown |¬†www.axieinfinity.com¬† 

 

Most project have a soft cap and hard cap of how much funds they will be raising. Often, whales will enter this space to buy up majority of the tokens which leaves very little for investors who truly support the project. 

And upon exchange listing, these whales send signal to various social media group indication that the token is a ‚ÄúBuy‚Äù as it is undervalued and will spike in the next couple months. Following this, the whales will dump these tokens as the price start to rise, leaving investors with tokens that are worth a lot less than what they paid for.¬† 

Smaller investors are on the losing of this because they are not able to leverage on ground floor prices when the tokens are released.",CryptoCurrency,4 Types of Token Offering Scams and How to Avoid them

I hope you're all having a lovely Monday. 

**A little bit about me:**

I'm a late twenties professional who intends to retire before I am 40. My cryptocurrencies forms the risk-on portion of my overall portfolio, and I'm hoping to achieve at least a 1,000% return over the next decade. While I've dabbled in cryptocurrencies for a while now, it wasn't until June of this year that I dove deep. Like many of you, I'm anticipating that the next six months will return life changing returns. Unfortunately work has been crazy of late, and will continue to be all throughout the next three or so months, so I will have very little time to focus on my portfolio.

**Help me restructure my portfolio:**

Given that I will have next to no time and energy to devout to my portfolio over the next three months, what changes would you make to my portfolio to maximise the return on what is essentially a 'fire and forget' strategy for the imminent future? Obviously it goes without saying that I am not seeking financial advice; just your opinion on whether my portfolio is primed to ride the exponential wave in the coming months. I have a week or so to do research on any last changes to my portfolio, before I have to set it in stone. So if you were me what changes (if any) would you make?

‚Äî Buying Process:

Coinbase is the best starting point, Check if coin (remember SHIB, paid extra via CB wallet) is available on CB. If not, Try Coinbase Wallet. In rare circumstance, I would consider buying from another wallet.

Also, Check slippage before buying, CB wallet does not have a good way to check that. Use other wallets to cross check that and compare fee estimates too.

Hey All,

I have this idea for a token on Cardano that will be used to integrate debt and assests into the blockchain. Adding Assests will greatly inflate the price of the token and although adding debt seams like a bad idea. Debt is actually a good thing as long as you dont have alot of it.

It will function like a Bank with the difference being anyone person who owns the tokens is basically considererd a ""owner"" and will get a say on how the systems upgrades and operates moving forward.

The main reason I want to do this is to take money and power away from institutions and banks and put it back into the hands of those who actually own it. The People!

Owning tokens will entitle you to monthly payments. (payments can be in fiat or crypto)

Using Governance we could also set up a system that allows for lending which would truly make it a bank by the people for the people.

Why would you put your money into a system that will then use that money against you. We have to put and end to this madness and greed.

We are all in this together. Lets start acting like it.

I have a much more detailed plan on how we can achieve this and I need more people to get involved.

I dont give a shit about money, I dont want any money for doing this. I want a better world for all of us. One where people at the top don't even have the option to fuck us.

Now, don't get me wrong; I don't hate SHIB. I don't own any, never will, but that's a decision I've made for myself.

druk_ware,1635133393,"Hi Crypto community. I have something to say about most launchpads. Please correct me if I'm wrong.¬†

If you're unfamiliar with launchpads, here's a breakdown:¬†

Essentially, launchpads help crypto projects get initial funding from the general public. There is a whitelisting process selected at random in most cases, so not everyone gets to get in on a project early.¬†**BUT, EVERYONE HAS THE SAME CHANCE TO GET IN.**

======================================================================

Let's take DAOmaker as an example.¬†

I found DAOmaker in February 2021, after they pivoted from a social mining platform to a platform whose core message was *""Venture Capital Re-Created for the Masses""* platform.¬†

Their DAO token was used as an entry to participate in the whitelisting process known as Strong Holder Offering. Projects could choose who they wanted to grant entry to, and participants could be refunded if the projects tank. **Sounds pretty fair, right? To me, it was.**¬†

(I'm sure they had some kind of advantage for users with more DAO tokens, but it was still generally more leveled than it is today.)

Come September 1st, 2021, when they introduced the new tiered system:¬†

&gt;Tranche 0:¬†  
&gt;  
&gt;500 - 1,999 DAO ‚ÄúEarly Adopters‚Äù Winning Chance 1.  
&gt;  
&gt;Tranche 1:¬†¬†  
&gt;  
&gt;2,000 - 3,999 DAO Winning Chance 4.67  
&gt;  
&gt;Tranche 2:¬†¬†  
&gt;  
&gt;4,000 - 9,999 DAO Winning Chance 9.76  
&gt;  
&gt;Tranche 3:¬†¬†  
&gt;  
&gt;10,000+ DAO Winning Chance 26  
&gt;  
&gt;Tranche 4:¬†¬†  
&gt;  
&gt;25,000+ DAO Winning Chance 69.5  
&gt;  
&gt;Tranche 5:¬†¬†  
&gt;  
&gt;50,000+ DAO Winning Chance 149  
&gt;  
&gt;""Early adopters"" refers to all users, who had a minimum of 500 DAO staked in the Vaults before September 1st, 2021 and kept it staked.¬†  
&gt;  
&gt;All new entries are required 2,000 DAO in their Wallets for SHO participation. Winning chances mean increased winning chance to tranche 0. For example tranche 3 has required 20 times more DAO, but provides 26 times higher winning chances. It, therefore, provides a boost of 6x chance.

======================================================================

I'll admit, I bought into the new tiered system and got myself 2,000 DAO power.

**But, I still think what DAOmaker (and lots of other launchpads) is doing now goes against what they used to stand for:**¬†***To give retail investors a chance to join ICOs and presales even though they don't have the capital like institutional investors¬†(I.E. VENTURE CAPITALISM RE-CREATED FOR THE MASSES).***

Tonnes of people get into crypto for a chance to get out of the rat race of earning low-middle income and live a peaceful leanFIRE life. 2,000 DAO at the peak is $17,500 (considered ATH: $8.75). That's way more than what a lot of people save per year. And they can't even use that money to invest in ICOs because it's stuck as DAO power. Then, they still have to scrounge another 200-500 BUSD which they don't have. Imagine buying at the ATH and losing $11,800 (using today's price of $2.85). Sounds a little unfair to me.¬†

On top of that, people with 50,000 DAO power essentially dominate the SHOs with 149 chances of winning an entry. Compared to the real O.G.s who stayed from the beginning who only have 1 pathetic chance of winning with 500 DAO power.¬†

In other words, the $142,500 is more likely to make another $10k with an entry to an ICO (or whatever IDO IEO nonsense) than someone with $1,425.¬†¬†

DAOmaker is becoming the problem it was trying to solve.¬†**What was once a leveled playing field where everyone had the same chance to win is now** ***peak capitalism‚Äì‚Äìthe exact problem crypto is trying to solve.***¬†

It doesn't matter if everyone has a small chance to win. It's leveled. It's crypto. Deal with it.¬†

If you're some rich dude who wants an edge, then ask your rich dad for investment opportunities over at Lord Farquard's private equity firm and get off crypto.¬†

This also goes for any other launchpads with tiered entries like DuckStarter etc.¬†

I get that DAOmaker wants to make big bucks. Stop making crypto like high finance and capitalism and elitist. Then, stop labeling yourself as ""for the retailers"" and call it as it is.¬†

Thanks for coming to my ted talk.

(P.S. Props to Binance who has kept launchpads fair for all its users.) 

(P.P.S. Not affiliated, but if you're interested in getting into presales without the help of launchpads,¬†[ICOdrops.com](https://ICOdrops.com)¬†has a pretty great list of upcoming projects. Some don't hold their presales on these launchpads.)",CryptoCurrency,The Ugly Side of Launchpads

About 5 months ago the same co-worker said I should check out my ETH I saw it was over 1000.00. Long story short I was hooked.

The biggest barrier for me was the technology first was doing KYC for the exchange I joined and figuring  how to use wallets and move my coins around the blockchain without losing any. I have decent computer skills but it was still a steep learning curve for me and I feel that is one of the reasons less people my age even try to invest in crypto. I am sure some boomers  hear about the returns that are possible but have not even heard of the blockchain let alone understand it.

 So i bought a couple books Bubble or Revolution and the Infinite machine. Listened to podcasts and watched YouTube videos. I also bought near the ATH and was shocked by my first big Dip last summer  luckily I had joined this Subreddit where I learned FOMO which I had just been guilty of, also Hodling and Staking and the strategy to DCA which I did during the last dip. And also  don't trust anyone and take all advice with a grain of salt and most importantly DYOR.I am now up 57 % so thank you to this community for the education i received here.

When I try to talk to anyone my age about the possibilities of DeFi ( after I explain DeFi to them ) they shrug me off  i think some of them can not even grasp the concept or implications of it. I try to explain that I am making 5 to 12 % staking on my coins  (after trying to explain what Staking is to them ) its way better then the banks and how much I am up ( that could change in a day ) but they just roll their eyes.

VegetableFortune7886,1635130614,"Hi Everyone, this question has been bugging me for a long time and I am genuinely curious about what drives the technology and decision.

Let's hope I get this question explained correctly and it probably exists on many platforms but I have only seen it on kucoin.  I'll use an exact example.

I'm trying to trade coin ERG.  I see there is an open order in the buy section for $9 and 800 coins are in the open order.  Because ERG is traded in relatively low volume the order has been there for a while.  I make a decision to place an order for the exact value of the open order.  That order disappears before my order is executed.  

I would say that this is just a coincidence but it's happened numerous times.  The open order withdraws their order before my order is excited so I'm certain that something is gaming the system where likely arbitrage bots can likely see an order come in before it's executed and can pull the bot order.  At least that's what I'm thinking happens.

I couldn't crosspost because the original post contained a Video &amp; links, which would automatically get deleted.  


&amp;#x200B;

&gt;The idea behind Ethereum is ingenious: Connect computers from all over the world to build the most decentralized world-computer possible. However, we also all have seen the problems of the current, monolithic ‚Äúone blockchain fits all‚Äù solution: Exploding fees, clogged network, long processing times and subsequently slow adoption in the real-world. You have all heard about Ethereum layer 2 solutions like Elrond or Polygon. But have you ever considered to solve Ethereums problems by seeing it as a second layer of an even more fundamental network?  
&gt;  
&gt;This is exactly the strategy the IOTA foundation revealed with its recent IOTA smart contract protocol (ISCP) beta release.  
&gt;  
&gt;They made the unique decision to have smart contracts not as a part of their feeless base-layer (the ‚ÄúTangle‚Äù), but instead as a second layer solution. Each smart contract is one individual blockchain and is run by its own committee of nodes. This committee performs all smart contract computations internally and connects to the IOTA main-layer to create and send digital assets (NFTs, wrapped tokens, etc.) IOTA tokens and to communicate seamlessly with all other IOTA smart contract chains.  
&gt;  
&gt;This layout allows IOTA smart contracts to be extremely flexible in design, different for each usecase and each user, while bein extremely scalable. It is the antithesis of the ‚Äúone blockchain fits all‚Äù paradigm, a true cooperative multi-blockchain environment.  
&gt;  
&gt;**IOTA smart contract chain can choose freely between:**  
&gt;  
&gt;\- **Permissionless** (for high decentralization) **or permissioned** (for trusted consortia) validators  
&gt;  
&gt;\- **PoW, PoS, PoX** or any other consensus mechanism  
&gt;  
&gt;\- **Being feeless or getting paid in any currency** (outside of the network in fiat or other crypto currencies, with a currency minted inside your IOTA smart contract blockchain (i.e. ETH) or with the native IOTA token)  
&gt;  
&gt;\- **Creating own internal tokens** (IOTA smart contract chains are complete blockchains after all)  
&gt;  
&gt;\- **Communicate feeless and seamlessly with other SCs over the IOTA Tangle.** You can interact with other smart contracts, build complex multi-SC networks and send around data, L2 tokens (i.e. ETH) or IOTA-based L1 token to every other connected SC chain.  
&gt;  
&gt;\- **Control IOTA tokens and IOTA digital assets on the Tangle**  
&gt;  
&gt;\- **Use any programming language you want** (currently supported Rust, Go and **Solidity (Ethereum virtual machine)**, many more languages and bridges planned).  
&gt;  
&gt;As you can see, IOTA smart contracts can be made in any way any company, government, DeFi developer, game-designer or private person would want them. It is a completely open playing field, a sandbox, ready to be flooded with ideas and use-cases.  
&gt;  
&gt;**The role of Ethereum in the IOTA smart contracts eco-system (‚ÄúApes together strong‚Äù)**  
&gt;  
&gt;IOTA is not an Ethereum-killer, it is an Ethereum enabler.  
&gt;  
&gt;Ethereum is plagued by unpredictable fees and a clogged network because every single Banano -&gt; Squirtle-coin swap needs to be processed by this literal world-computer. Every crypto-kitty, gambling-app or other fun little smart-contract project today gets secured with the insane levels of hash-power a literal world-computer has to offer and in turn becomes slow and expensive. Yes, there is a thing as having TO MUCH security for your crypto application and your latest gambling roulette or smart-neighborhood application in a suburb of Buenos Aires is a prime example for that.  
&gt;  
&gt;All these smaller and mid-size use-cases can now migrate onto the IOTA Tangle (IOTA 2.0 DevNet for now, mainnet next year) by creating their own, individual smart contract chains. Decentralized finance can for example be performed by smaller consortia using proof of stake on an individual smart contract chain. Gaming apps can be processed by just some dozens of validators instead of hundreds of thousands. Both speed and costs of DEXes would improve DRAMATICALLY ‚Äì no more 100$ swaps that take one hour! We are talking DeFi happening in seconds and for the cost of mere cents.  
&gt;  
&gt;**So what¬¥s the role of Ethereum here?**  
&gt;  
&gt;In this new context Ethereum can be seen the most decentralized and highest security IOTA smart contract chain possible. It will be the go-to solution for REALLY high stake smart contracts like high value life-insurances or large real-estate trades.  
&gt;  
&gt;Ethereum gains from being part of IOTA smart contract landscape:  
&gt;  
&gt;\- High reliability and use-ability for high-value use-cases because it is less clogged by smaller projects and games  
&gt;  
&gt;\- Seamless communication with ALL OTHER smart contracts on IOTA, even those which are impossible on Ethereum as of today (such as permissioned smart contracts by industry consortia)  
&gt;  
&gt;\- A more diversified and therefore decentralized crypto-landscape, no single point-of-failure  
&gt;  
&gt;Growth of the cryptocurrency space can only happen when technology evolves and projects work together ‚Äì not ‚Äúkill‚Äù each other. This is now possible in a previously unknown new direction: Not by adding second layers on top of Ethereum, but instead adding a ‚Äú**Layer 0**‚Äù solution under its feet.",CryptoCurrency,"Layer 0 - The real reason why Dominik Schiener, Co-founder IOTA Foundation said ‚ÄúIOTA is NOT an Ethereum killer‚Äù"

Sopongebob123,1635128065,"I think I found that group randomly on Instagram where they have just a couple of followers but when I checked their Telegram, I was quite shocked to see 150k members there. As I try to experience all the possible things you can do in the crypto space, I naturally joined to see how that process work. Here is a short summary of the annoying journey. 

&amp;#x200B;

**When?**

The group doesn't allow any comments besides their own announcements. These announcements have a very simple order. They tell you when will the next pump happen and then they send several reminders as you're getting closer to the pump day. I think that they do these pumps around 2-3 times per week or something like every three days.

&amp;#x200B;

**How?**

There is a set time for when the pump starts. On the exact time and day it was planned, the announcement will display a simple message that just states the specific token's symbol. That seems to always happen at 6pm UK time and at the very second this happens, the price skyrockets. That only lasts for about a minute. For another minute the price hovers around the same high price and then it starts to drop hard basically to the pre-pump price. The owners of the group state something like that they ""hold the pump for two minutes to attract outside investors"", but I think that's just a clever statement how to screw over a lot of people. I will come back to this in the conclusion below.

&amp;#x200B;

**Where?**

So all of this happens at Hotbit exchange which I've never used before and it just look so bad. I'm sure there is a very good (shady) reason why the pump group uses this exchange but I don't know the details so feel free to expand on this!

&amp;#x200B;

**My own experience**

I prepared around 28 USDT and sent it to Hotbit (I did that by swapping it around with XLM to save on gas fees). I had the Exchange tab at Hotbit ready and Telegram opened on my phone, waiting for the ""signal"". As soon as the token symbol was revealed, I typed it to the search tab and tried to swap all my USDT as the price was immediately climbing high too fast. The price per token before the pump was $0.0038. My trade went through 19 seconds after the pump started when the price already grew 1000% to $0.039! I didn't really know what to do because the interface of Hotbit is so bad but I knew if I will hold longer than another few seconds, I will be screwed. I quickly sold everything at $0.051 (highest point of the pump was $0.06) making around $10 profit.

&amp;#x200B;

**Conclusion**

Sounds good? Actually not at all! It only took few seconds for the price to reach the top which means if your trade goes through just a little bit late, you will buy at the top and watch your money lose 10x of its value in the next minute. Obviously there must be a shit ton of people who already know which coin will be pumped and all the small flies like me only help them to pump it more. I think that the statement about ""attracting outside investors"" is just bs because the price wouldn't drop back to the original value if there were more people outside of the group buying.

If you want to play around and risk with your money, this is a fun thing to try out but remember you can easily end up with $100 worth of shitcoin after putting in $1000. You will definitely never be able to buy fast enough to get those 1100% profits so don't let that blind you. I was super lucky and got out with like 30% profit? I'm sure that's just because I put in a small amount of USDT. Was that like 10k USDT, the trade might have been executed at the top and I would turn into a clown ü§°

OfficialNewMoonville,1635127894,"Fantom has been one of the outstanding emerging stars since the summer, and has already more than 10Xed since August. With the Fantom Developer Conference currently getting started in Dubai, and a real possibly of some big Halloween pumps on the horizon, I'd like to introduce the Fantom ecosystem and hopefully help some people who are getting started for the first time. 

# Why Fantom? 

There is a lot to like about Fantom, but one of the main draws at the moment seems to be the ultra-low gas fees and super fast transaction speeds. Fantom represents a great alternative for retail investors to get started in DeFi, given the current cost barriers for the average investor in the Ethereum network. Earlier this year Fantom transfers and smart contact interactions cost less than a cent to approve. Despite the gas fees rising substantially since then, as the network gains in popularity and Fantom moons, you can still make transactions for pennies. 

Most importantly, Fantom enabled retail investors to actually use their coins. Gas fees are *absurdly cheap* and *wicked fast*. Right now they are the highest they've ever been and it still cost less than ten cents to move stuff around. Usually it costs pennies.

# Where Can I Buy Fantom? 

Fantom is currently avaliable on Binance, KuCoin, FTX, Gemini, SushiSwap, Crypto.com, and many other exchanges. Not listed on CoinBase yet but it seems like it is only a matter of time. 

If you buy Fantom on Binance you can move your coins off of the exchange and to your private wallet for the low low cost of 0.01 FTM.

# The Official Fantom Wallet 

You can get the [Official Fantom Wallet here.](https://fantom.foundation/wallets/?__cf_chl_jschl_tk__=pmd_yuxqSPn39nlYkpMJspC_u4bKDepvZww_IaApnN5v.4I-1633646961-0-gqNtZGzNAfujcnBszQj9) Might look a bit old-school at the moment but this is still V1 and it is rumored to be getting an upgrade very soon, possibly to be announced this week at the Fantom Developer Conference. Official Fantom Wallet allows you to stake your FTM for some pretty impressive staking rewards (can be 10% plus if you don't mind looking it for a significant period). 

# Configuring MetaMask 

[This blog post here](https://www.weirdo.rocks/blog/tutorial-how-to-setup-fantom-ftm-on-metamask-and-get-started#toc-add-the-fantom-opera-network-to-your-metamask) enables you to set up your MetaMask wallet to join the Fantom Ecosystem in a relatively easy and painless procedure.

**Step 4: Send Yourself Some Fantom **

# SpookySwap (BOO) 

Right now the undisputed star of the Fantom eco-system is [SpookySwap](https://spookyswap.finance/), an all-in-one DEX that allows users to swap tokens, provide liquidity, yield farm, stake their tokens and bridge tokens between the Fantom network and others. SpookySwap is also releasing an official NFT collection at the end of this month, if that is your thing. 

The Native SpookySwap token, BOO, has a max supply of 13,600,000, of which more than half are already circulating. It is currently ranked 396th by MarketCap, according to CoinGecko. BOO can be staked on the SpookySwap app with APRs in the 34-54% range, with 23.15% APR made in BOO and a further variable amount paid in a token of your choosing (I get an extra 19.9% paid in DAI). 

If SpookySwap doesn't grab you, maybe take a look at [Spirit Swap, the SpookySwap rival.](https://app.spiritswap.finance/)

# Tarot 

Tarot is a decentralized lending protocol where users can participate as lenders or borrowers in isolated lending pools. By supplying the pools in Tarot you can get APRs of up to 30% on FTM (as of right now), and up to 120% on the Native token Tarot, which can count Andre Cronje and [Vitalik Buterin himself](https://mobile.twitter.com/Jacktheoiler/status/1451140690734321669?s=20) among the current users.

Tarot has a market cap of less than $25,000,000 right now, despite $200,000,000+ in Total Value Locked on Tarot right now. 

The project is still in its early days, so if the UI doesn't grab you, you can try alternatives such as Abracadabra (SPELL) and Mushrooms.Finance (MM).

# The Future 

Fantom is a very new and rapidly evolving ecosystem, so there is a lot more to discover, including NFT platforms, staking and yield farming solutions, the works. In my opinion the best thing about using the Fantom Network right now is being able to discover DeFi without paying Ethereum prices. Although it is certainly a bit harder than buying coins to leave on exchanges and speculate with, it has really opened my eyes to what is possible when we actually use our coins and move them around. 

Good luck getting started. And credit to u/JasonLuxton and u/TonyBarnaby for getting me started on the Fantom Ecosystem myself.

Diatery,1635127719,"Irish company Domila Limited is working with the University of Guadalajara on a pilot crypto project called Hoozies, which has legit ties to the IEEE as part of a 5G Smart Cities initiative. It's unclear how many businesses are participating on the pilot program, but the press release says over 1,800 users have signed up for the Hoozie app (Android, iOS) and 1.2 million pesos have been contributed for it's development.  

Here's how it works:

&gt;Hoozies can also be earned through the use of public transport, running and cycling. Riding a bike for 30 minutes, for example, earns a hoozie app user 10 hoozies. People get 50 hoozies if they sign up a friend to the app and 100 if they sign up a business.  
&gt;  
&gt;When people use the digital currency to make purchases in participating businesses, 4% of the value of the transaction is returned to them in hoozies.

It also works as a P2P / B2B app where you can sell your services and pay people directly through the app. There's some cashback campaigns for flocking to participating businesses.

What's unclear is what blockchain technology is under the hood, and whether or not we'll see Hoozies on exchanges any time soon.  Here's the most technical thing I could find about it: 

"" This project is promoted by the quadruple helix, composed by the SICyT through the COECYTJAL; by the technological firm HP, the Office of Visitors and Conventions (OFVC), ANTAD, the University of Guadalajara (UdeG), the innovation ecosystem of the European community represented by the company DOMILA LTD (Ireland), as well as by international associations as the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE IoT Smart Cities), being the world's largest organization in technology.¬† ""

Furthermore, in an interview the project leader Joel Myers said Hoozies technically isn't a cryptocurrency since it is pegged to the local currency... which is interesting. That reminds me of all of those godforsaken 90's internet payment dot-com bombs like Beenz and Flooz, which failed miserably.  You'd think they'd have consulted UrbanDictionary first, which has a colorful alternative definition. However, in a different interview Myers also says it uses blockchain technology. So which is it? This is like a more well thought-out version of El Salvador, but more centralized and dorky but wholesome.

SHIB could potentially reach an 80 Billion Dollar Market Cap within the next few months (.0002 per coin) and potentially 320 BILLION Dollar Market Cap by 2023 (.0008 per coin).

This is based off of Dogecoin‚Äôs previous market cap high of 80 Billion Dollars, that it reached back earlier this year. The bullrun has continued and Shiba Inu has overtaken Dogecoin in terms of popularity. Based on social media metrics, Shiba Inu is now one of the most popular cryptocurrencies with more mentions on Reddit and Twitter than Dogecoin (SHIB Gets More Mentions on Twitter Than Bitcoin, Ethereum, DOGE - ELEVENEWS).

There‚Äôs no reason Shiba can‚Äôt rise to Doge‚Äôs previous all time market cap high.

Nervous_Sky_5167,1635123562,"Tl;dr: The post talking about crypto supply centralization and how only a minute minority own a vast majority of coins is extremely misleading. They go on to claim how this is a 'core principle of economics' and how coin supply centralization is an incredibly precise indicator. Not to mention the title is full of spelling mistakes...

If you haven't seen what I mean, here's their post: [https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/qetjrx/the\_terrifying\_of\_totaly\_supply\_of/](https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/qetjrx/the_terrifying_of_totaly_supply_of/)

Now here's why coin supply centralization doesn't dictate everything about a coin:

**Selective Age Bias** \- As a cryptocurrency gets older and more mature, supply is offloaded from whales to other people. That is how basic money flow works. As time passes on, supply tends to get more evened out as that select cryptocurrency gets most expensive to accumulate, both from a literal and opportunity cost standpoint. This is why the cryptocurrencies that are older tend to have less coin supply centralization (i.e. ETH or the oldest of them all, BTC).

**Selective Exchange Bias** \- Another part of selective bias comes from exchanges. Older and more established cryptocurrencies tend to have more self-custody audiences (i.e. ETH or BTC). Newer or more speculative cryptocurrencies tend to exist mainly on exchange accounts, which show up as one centralized wallet (i.e. SHIB).

**Pseudo-anonymity** \- Most cryptocurrency wallets have no name or organization name, but despite the open-blockchain aspect, are known as 'pseudo-anonymous networks. Because of this, you cannot know whether the whale wallet you're looking at is a *centralized exchange wallet (i.e. Coinbase), fund wallet (i.e. private funds),* or an actual *personal* wallet (*my wallet)*. You also don't know whether a single person owns multiple wallets, their balances spread across them all in order to deter suspicion, or if multiple people own a single wallet (i.e. multi-sig wallet). 

I'm not here to root for any specific cryptocurrency. I just want to prove the facts, facts that the previous OP glossed over. There's a reason why the examples I just listed are mostly under *selective bias* psychology, and that's because the previous OP was probably cherry-picking details to mastermind his own ideals. 

It's kinda sad how that post was up-voted to high heaven since nobody really took any care in analyzing the details. Speaks volume of our echo-chamber subreddit.",CryptoCurrency,One of the top posts about crypto supply centralization is misleading and outright lying.

Fair enough, and each unto their own, but I'd thought I'd share a typical grift NFT market places use to maximize profits.

Person A, let's call them Shill9000. A 200k subscriber Youtuber, a typical Crypto Bro that even though preachers people need to be careful somehow still claims they're selling their bags for a new crypto project every week.

Person B, let's call them RealShady. A large NFT marketplace or crypto entity that has basically an endless supply of NFT.

RealShady needs more profits. They reach out to Shill9000 and say hey if you just advertise buying and selling a specific NFT for us we will give you 20k, and if it goes well expect this to be ongoing.

Shill9000 goes yeah sure, I like money.

RealShady sends 100k in whatever coin to Shill9000 with instructions to buy NotWorthADollar NFT. Shill9000 makes a new video with them buying a NFT for 100k (forgets to mention it's not with his money, or that the seller is RealShady). Cue cringe YouTube thumbnail. Shill9000 then makes a new video of them selling said NFT for 120k!!! Needless to say the video gets alot of views.

RealShady meanwhile has just brought NotWorthADollar NFT back for 120k through an unconnected account. Effectively giving Shill9000 a 20k payment. What they have also done is convinced a large amount of people that these types of NFT's are worth alot of money and more importantly that you can quickly sell them for a nice windfall.

Those watchers through no fault of their own now talk to friends and social media and the news further spreads. ""Hey I have inside information that X style NFT is where the money is at"".

Now RealShady sits back and watches as most of them get snapped up. Most for a much lower price then 120k but that's part of the con, as they aren't worth anything so convincing people 2k is cheap is the win. All of them being owned by them until the copycats arrive means RealShady has made alot more than 20k it cost to engineer the hype. 

In the hype some can be easily sold for the ridiculous price but in a month or two alot of people will be just bag holders with unprofitable NFT's.

crua9,1635122666,"So something that appears to be within the rules at this second but is talk about being against the rules possibly next year on. It's using wash sells to deduct from taxes. Note there is no clear answer if prior wash sells before the ruling will be allowed to use as a deduction or if they wont count for future deductions.

Anyways, what is a wash sell. More than less it is when you sell at a loss, and then rebuy within 30 days.

So where does this link to grid bots. If you're on LIFO then this doesn't matter. But since places like koinly, CoinTracker, and other places do a universal LIFO or FIFO. This most likely is a problem for the many. Like if you can find a tracker that let's you change it per sell then let me know.

Anyways, how a grid bot works is basically you have an upper and lower limit. You sat per grid buy/sell x amount of coins (for example 100 coins). And it does it. When it moves up and crosses grids it sells and it buys as it moves down.

Now the problem comes in when let's say $5 it buys $4 it buy $3 and $2. Then it goes from $2 to $3 and it sells. With FIFO the tax will look at it as you sold the coins you bought at $5. So it will be a loss. And now the price drop back to $2. Now it bought and this is where your wash sell came in.

(what makes it worse when it hits $5 it will have a massive gain. So this means you will pay taxes on massive gains while having massive losses. And if the wash sell rule is in place, you can't deduct any of the loss. Which means you now have a major major tax bill. But even if the wash rule isn't in place. You can only deduct $3k a year. And this means you again are stuck paying a ton more in taxes than you should.)


I learned this the hard way. This problem looks like it will cost me about 3 to 4 times more in taxes than I should've. But since I'm poor and can't afford a CPA. I'm pretty much screwed.


But note giving the wash sell rule never takes place and you make enough to pay for everything including a good cpa. I think this is worth it still. But for us poor folks. Idk

First and foremost Reddit thank you for hearing me out. [u/johnny\_kucoin](https://www.reddit.com/u/johnny_kucoin/) Has responded to my post and I have also followed up.

I am going to share all the details with you as I am not going to censor them to paint a picture for myself.

For what it's worth. I want to be wrong, and I love Kucoin. I feel betrayed by their actions and I tried to give them every chance to explain their actions. This resulted in me finally bringing my concerns to their own subreddit and they insta banned me ending a 2-month debacle of inquiries.

On a positive note, they have since lifted my ban on [r/kucoin](https://www.reddit.com/r/kucoin/) since the post blew up a bit

I think it's important to hear out Kucoin and the team. this is not a witch hunt.

Sadly

They dont ever address the issues.

Cloud flare is an industry tool and the most widely used Edge Network service. Under normal circumstances it is great, but like any tool, it can be weaponized

I do believe this is what's happening here.

It seems they want to talk about how everyone uses Cloudflare and how much they spend on AWS (amazon)

I do know for a fact other exchanges do the same thing, and if and when it comes up I will do the exact same thing to those exchanges but only when I have sufficient material to present.

Additionally, Johnny Lyu says he doesn't know why I got banned but guesses ""maybe spamming?""

If he went and looked at my post history for 34 seconds he would know that is very much not true.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Here is his PM to ME as follows:

[u/johnny\_kucoin](https://www.reddit.com/u/johnny_kucoin/)

Noted. Will discuss with the team

Also, noticed on the post you created. Here's our response FYI

Thanks for raising your question about KuCoin. As the People‚Äôs Exchange, we always pursue user satisfaction. Regarding the issues you mentioned, we are very willing to discuss them openly and transparently.

Firstly, Cloudflare is a world-renowned CDN solution. As you said, one of its main functions is to prevent DDoS attacks, which is also our main purpose for deploying it. Currently, almost all major exchanges are working closely with Cloudflare.

All exchanges have applied an access frequency limit through Cloudflare to ensure the stability of their services. Once the limit has been surpassed, denial of website access may occur. When setting the limit, we discussed thoroughly with high-frequency traders, like API traders, for instance, before concluding on the limit. We believe that in most cases, the frequency limit will not affect our users. But it is possible that, when there‚Äôs a big price move or someone visits the site too frequently, 504 pages may still appear due to the limitation. We have been working on improving this for a while, and if you encountered such an issue, we would appreciate it if you could share the RAY ID from the 504 pages with our support team so that we can better solve the problem. Thank you.

Secondly, regarding the AWS server, KuCoin invests a lot in IT infrastructure and network security. Compared with other exchanges of our size and scale, our investment in AWS servers is almost twice as much as theirs. And we will continue to invest in this sector as we know this is one of the fundamentals of our services.

In fact, as a platform, we care about usability and stability more than anyone else. The access issue will not only impact KuCoin's revenue but also affect user experience. As a platform dedicated to building itself and the industry for the long term, we know that reputation is everything. We hope that all users can trade with KuCoin easily and pleasantly, achieve their investment goals, and even improve their lives. As a neutral platform, we do not profit from users' liquidation. Therefore, we are constantly introducing new functions and educating users to help them manage their futures positions properly and reduce the risk of liquidation.

Having noticed that you‚Äôve been banned in the KuCoin Subreddit, I am checking with the team for the reason, but our current guess is due to spamming. We have unbanned your account. All opinions are welcomed in our community, no matter if they are positive or negative. We are very sorry for the inconvenience. As for the Moderator List you claimed that we made private, actually we didn‚Äôt change any setting on that. It‚Äôs likely because banned users cannot see it. Please check again since you are now unbanned.

Since its establishment in 2017, we have experienced many ups and downs, but KuCoin always believes in the future of crypto. So, we will continue to invest in our system and strive to provide users with a better experience. I apologize again for the inconvenience. If you have any questions about KuCoin, our 24/7 customer support will always be there to help you out. If you are unhappy with their services, you can also DM me at any time, and I am very happy to help you. Thank you.

Here is my response

Johnny,

I am going to post this publicly so here is the TLDR summary

* You are running a business that solely functions on the web, and do a self proclaimed 1 billion in transactions a day.  

   * This is done without industry standard fail safes and protocols/ redundancy
   * You do this without informing the public of your audaciously poor risk management protocols.
* Your website, API‚Äôs, and app servers are going down and still processing orders on the backend  

   * Stop losses are not always triggering and the situation is not being made right
* Your website is not failing over
* There is ZERO fail safe or kill switch that cancels orders or suspends trades when the servers go down despite this being common industry practice)
* When the website does not fail over by design
* Cloudflare is being weaponized to deny access to the web server rather than failing over to a redundant gateway/ web server.
* Kucoin is knowing taking funds and keeping them when this happens
* All retail traders are sent to an endless customer service feedback look that gives them literally no resolution

You can elect to fix these issues and go back and actually settle all the funds that were literally stolen by Kucoin. Subsequently you can fix your technical architecture.

Anything less than this and you are playing politics and the community will see ZERO action on this matter.

\_\_\_\_\_\_

The extended answer to your response is as follows:

The one thing I will accuse you of publicly Johnny is being disingenuous. Let's stop the politics and get on with the resolution.

It's sad that it took my subreddit post on [r/Cryptocurrecy](https://www.reddit.com/r/Cryptocurrecy/) getting to the top of the subreddit for you to acknowledge the issue.

It's frankly disturbing I was instantly censored for publicly speaking up on this matter on [r/kucoin](https://www.reddit.com/r/kucoin/). I was not banned for ‚Äúspam,‚Äù I am happy to review everyone of my posts with you to prove this.

I am not the only one that has been censored, there is a pattern of behavior surrounding Kucoins social media management to ban any counter perspective if it has weight.

On to the technical portion:

Everyone uses Cloudflare in almost every industry. It's good that you are using Cloudflare.

In your situation Cloudflare is not innocuous; it has been weaponized. Your Cloudflare settings and policy are such that it does not fail over to redundant infrastructure but treats retail traders as if they are doing a DDOS attack and denying access.

Why is Cloudflare denying access under Kucoins settings and policies? Liquidations are happening while people are still exhibiting and practising proper risk management protocols.

In our instance on September 7th we were intermittently denied access for 5 hours.

Cloudflare either accelerates or decelerates requests to recover or improve application and or web performance.

Cloudflare has the option to failover to redundant website gateways should your peak loads exceed their capability. For enterprise level websites such as Kucoin this is combined with a Ge load balancer that balances user loads to different gateways based of the users source IP and a ton of other policies that get add in in (these are too numerous to document here, I am happy to defer anyone to whitepapers on the matter).

In Kucoins instance they have consciously opted to not fail over website gateways. This means that users are being denied access as the only other viable option when your gateway goes down

To say everyone uses cloudflare as we do is also disingenuous.

For lack of a better metaphor, if you swing a hammer (Cloudflare) and hit some patrons, you can't turn to the crowd and say ‚Äúhey folks it's just a hammer (Cloudflare)‚Ä¶. Everyone has one.‚Äù

To mention your Amazon AWS spend is also disingenuous:

By virtue of the fact you're not opting for a failover gateway and geo load balancing but still processing trades that result in liquidation while retail investors get locked out of their accounts is not ok.

Your IT spend is irrelevant.

You have a fiduciary duty and the trust of the community to tend to their funds and respect their trades. This trust is being violated and repainted as ‚Äúan IT outage and then blame shifting to the retail trader themselves saying they need to exhibit better risk management.‚Äù

You don't get to lock people out of their house for several hours and subsequently burn the house to the ground and blame shift telling them to act more responsibly.

You have ZERO plausible deniability here!

I brought this to your attention personally as I also did with your help desk and our customer Rep Zoe.

Cloudflare and outages are keeping people from accessing their account. Their money is being taken, and Helpdesk sends them to an endless loop with no path of escalation. No one is getting their funds or crypto actually restored after an outage to the point previous to that very outage. Cloudflare is denying access rather than deferring to other gateways to handle the load.

This is by design, there is no plausible deniability as I have personally brought this to your attention as well as the help desk. Since that time there have been no less than 5-10 more outages resulting in more losses by the community.

You have 2 options on how to fix this issue (both of which should be implemented tied together)

* A kill switch (see below)
* Or failing over to a redundant gateway/ webhead and geo load balancing the load.

Again, you would still do both to protect the people

Kucoin has consciously made a choice to do neither after I repeatedly brought this up.

I repeat for emphasis here ‚ÄúYou have no plausible deniability.‚Äù

**This puts Kucoin on par with Robinhood the app on how they removed AMC, GME, and Dogecoin buy/ sell functionality to benefit the exchanges needs.**

This is an old playbook that predates the Great Depression when banks would lock their doors so customers could not get to their funds for withdrawal to stop a run on the bank.

You are locking your doors via Cloud Flare and server outages stopping us from getting access to our property and breaching fiduciary duty in doing so.

I don't have data proving you have a liquidity issue but your behavior emulates the same issues demonstrated for literally hundreds of years.

Fix this shit immediately!

You can spend all the money on Amazon ( AWS) you want. It doesnt change the fact that your infrastructure prohibits people from accessing their account in times of need. You are locking the doors, stopping people, while putting Kucoin‚Äôs interests first

They are liquidated even when they follow proper risk management protocol. They are left powerless, and have no path of engagement to rectify the situation. IF it gets to you, you don't ever actually fix the situation but send every person back down the ladder.

Ask our account Rep Zoe. The person you personally directed us to, and did not deal with our issue either. We have been having this conversation for 2 months!

The situations are not rectified.

I am happy to post all of my emails and telegram messages to back up what I am saying here right now.

Your website could absolutely fail over to a redundant gateway and take on the concurrent load, but it doesn't do that by design (literally). If you can't handle the load then you need to have a kill switch that pauses all trading activity no different than the HKex, CME, and other major exchanges.

[https://www.jpx.co.jp/english/systems/equities-trading/01.html](https://www.jpx.co.jp/english/systems/equities-trading/01.html)

Anything less is a breach of fiduciary duty of Kucoin and you as an individual, and frankly spitting in the face of everyone who believed you and trusted you.

These are all measures that I brought to your and your team's attention. No action was taken but repeated outages have happened.

.

I am calling bullshit that you don't know the exchange is going down and that you don't know that people's funds are not getting restored.

I can post my messages with you and all the team right now to back up what I am saying.

The fact stands your website goes down and you knowingly take peoples money. It's never restored and they are sent to an endless loop of customer service until they submit the stolen funds to you.

There is no kill switch and your website does not failover. The OTC desk still processes Institutional orders ( whales) while putting the people of the ‚Äúpeoples exchange‚Äù on the menu for harvesting.

The only reason you are responding to me and lifting my ban from Kucoins subreddit is the ‚Äúpeople‚Äù pulled together and put your company's reputation on the line.

That being said, you have an opportunity to right the situation at this very moment.

I will ask everyone to present their case and we publicly resolve these issues.

If your exchange can't handle the load all leveraged trades should be auto-cancelled without penalty and margin debt clocks are suspended with a path to restoration. Anything less than this and your words are mere words and not actions aka playing politics.

It's a de facto response from any broker/ exchange in a liquidity crisis to remove the buy/sell buttons or turn down the servers removing retail investor access.

Your website is removing retail access while still processing transactions and taking the hard earned funds of the community. No matter what you say this is the reality. It's calculated, it's methodical, and those funds are not being restored for more than 0.5% in a settlement best case scenario. The vast majority of users never have their funds restored.

Retail investors are literally being harvested by Kucoin.

This post is only round one of the screen shots, videos, scans and logs we have.

This is a point brought up several times on Reddit!

You are doing so with no failover or kill switch and exposing people to imminent risk and not informing them of your shody IT practices.

Yet when your website goes down it brings the API server and application server for the app down as well but you still manage to process orders on the back end via the OTC desk. To typically engage with an OTC desk the threshold is often 5 million to 35 million in assets.

So you are liquidating the little guy while providing white glove concierge service to whales.

I am calling you out on the carpet here and now asking you to do what you said you would do and repay those affected.

Subsequently fix your shit!

Lastly I want you to publicly answer one question

‚ÄúWhy did you remove the liquidation price from margin contracts and increase the liquidation risk of all retail traders??

\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*If you do not answer this question directly, I will publicly repeat it until you do.\*\*\*\*

You are taking away traders ability to manage risk and then accusing those same people of not managing risk when you liquidate them in an outage.

I am happy to keep sharing with the community what info I have on your environment and business practices ‚Äúif Kucoin does not exercise proper risk management‚Äù and proper fiduciary duties.

If a shitcoin has a 95% chance of doing nothing - or worse - losing you money, and it has a 5% chance of giving you 1,000% returns, then overall your ""expected returns"" are 1,000% x 5% = 50%. You'd literally be better off buying some BTC and ETH.

There is a place for speculation within a portfolio. If you speculated with 10-25% of a portfolio on DOGE at $0.002, you would've made tremendous returns. Just never go all-in. There are much better projects out there that have a much better risk profile.

Good luck investing, everyone. The next few months are going to be life-changing for many of y'all.",CryptoCurrency,SHIB and other shitcoins.

Sentinel35P,1635119954,"Last week, I had an ""afterwork"" convo about crypto with two colleagues whom I consider to be close friends.


I'm surprised that friend 1 is somewhat knowledgeable about crypto. He kept on repeating ADA, ALGO and some others as the having potentials. However, he is not invested at the moment. 


Friend 2 is somehow exposed to crypto by way of the Axie Infinity game where he is side-investing to his brother who has some scholars.


Anyway, our convo revolved in me discussing that it is the future, that we are still early, and the likes of thing spurned here in the sub. 


This kind of spiked the interest of friend 2 as he realized that he doesn't know much about crypto, except what he knew already in Axie.


As he had a lot of very specific questions, I told him about the concept of DYOR - Do your own research. I even told them about this sub and the community point system that is the Reddit Moons (which I have high hopes for the future, BTW). And I explained that I won't recommend any coin/token, except maybe to do his research on the top/blue chip like BTC and ETH.
Unknown to me, friend 2 entered the rabbit hole of crypto ""influencers"" on YT and FB. Last night, I received a message from friend 2, asking my opinion or though about Shiba Inu. It dragged me from my dreamy, sleepy state and woke me up. 


I said, just research on the concept of market cap and realize that it may not be up to what some people expects it to be, and that it is essentially a meme coin.
His answer horiffied me. He said, ""I invested in Shiba Inu and I have high hopes that it will surpass the 'dodge' coin. I think its too undervalued and it will reach 10USD.""


I said, you mean the Doge Coin, the one shilled be Elon Musk in the past? He said, yeah, that one. 


I was dumbfounded. I didn't expect a simple conversation last week will lead into this. But for all it's worth, he is in the green as we talked. This prompted me to tell him not invest in it in the long term.  Just know when to take profits and don't be greedy. I further explained the concept of market cap and why it is impossible for it to be at 10 USD (which was his initial target) in the future. The reason it's rallying at the moment is because of hype and also as aftereffects of the bullrun that we may be in rn.

The funny and somehow frustrating thing for me is the fact that he bought first then asked my opinion after. OMG!


The lesson here, I guess, and the piece of advice I learned, is to always be clear on what you say about cryptos when around friends and even families. Especially, explain to them that memecoins exist. Don't let them fall to FOMO. They may blame you later if they will get burned in the future. My friend just FOMO'ed in SHIBA INU after a brief convo with me. I may never get that off my head.",CryptoCurrency,"After a brief convo about cryptos, my 'idiot' friend, invoking DYOR that I talked about, FOMO'ed in SHIBA INU"
TiredRightNowALot,1635119650,"If you've been around crypto for a while, you know that your cryptocurrency wallet typically has a very long, strong set of words for the password / key.  The other thing you know is that people sometimes forget these words and lose access to their files.  That can be a frustrating thing.  It can also create internet legends, stories and ruin lives.

So why are they so difficult?  Well, that's because (in theory) you could have your entire life savings stored in crypto and then associated with this wallet.  Imagine having that password be easily cracked / guessed / stolen.  That wouldn't be good for anyone, including crypto as a technology.  Here are some examples of how hard passwords can be to crack with today's computers.

&amp;#x200B;

|Character Count|Lowercase Letters Only|Lower and Uppercase|Addition of numbers|Addition of symbols|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|8|5 seconds|22 minutes|1 hour|8 hours|
|9|2 minutes|19 hours|3 days|3 weeks|
|10|58 minutes|1 month|7 months|5 years|
|11|1 day|5 years|41 years|400 years|
|12|3 weeks|300 years|2000 years|34,000 years|

As you can see, the passwords get very difficult.  34,0000 years to guess 1LoveRedd1t! on average.  That's going to be a tough one.

Now, for a wallet seed phrase, let's say there are 12 random words.  There are a total of 2,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000 possible combinations of words.  This isn't something that even the most adventurous of hackers is going to try - it's not going to happen.

Searching for a reasonable explanation of time to guess this phrase is nearly impossible (to get a good answer).  But suffice to say, it's not going to happen until computers are running in some technology that we don't yet have (quantum computers aren't far off, to be fair).  One explanation I found states that if you were checking 1 Trillion combinations per second and ran the password cracker for 40 years, you'd be no where near 1% of the way through all of the combinations.  In fact, the math displayed shows that you would be this far:   0.000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000001%.  

**So why do people get their accounts hacked or stolen?**

Here are a few ways that people still lose their crypto (but not an all encompassing list)

1. Installing programs with a virus / keylogger
2. Accepting and air drop, invite or something from someone online that installs a program, runs a smart contract, or a slew of other exploits
3. Storing their password online in cloud storage (no point in storing your super secure 12 word seed phrase behind an 8 character password....)
4. Websites that are phishing for your data.  Enter your seed phrase here to sync your wallet and receive free shitcoin (this seems to happen more than I would have ever thought)

What to do....

1. Create a strong seed phrase (or write down the one given to you)
2. Write down your seed phrase physically and store it in a LOCKED and SAFE place
3. Store your seed phrase offline if you have to have it on USB or something else
4. NEVER enter your seed phrase online, ANYWHERE
5. Run a virus program, keep it up to do
6. Be skeptical and protect your information.

Amelie007,1635119127,"Hi, I put a lot of effort into this and I hope it can help you or at least inform you in how to better protect your precious crypto from the most widely used attacks and scams out there.

**1. Phishing Attacks**: This involves clicking on a link that takes you to a fake website that resembles a legitimate site in order to get you to sign-in and steal your login credentials. An example would be getting an e-mail that looks legitimate, pretending to be from an exchange that you use, asking you to immediately secure your account because it has been compromised or something to that effect. In the subject of the e-mail a link is provided which you click but instead of taking you to the legitimate site it takes you to an identical fake website where you input your login credentials. In the process you hand over your details to the attacker, which proceeds to login to the legitimate site and drain your funds.

* *Best way to avoid these*: Bookmark the legitimate sites on your browser and only login to them directly from there, and never from an external link, always verify a site's security (making sure the site‚Äôs URL begins with ‚Äúhttps‚Äù with a closed lock icon and check the security certificate as well).

**2. SIM swap attacks**: Spoofing someone's SMS is actually easier than most people think, and once an attacker can divert your SMS to their phone they can bypass 2FA checks, reset passwords and gain access to your accounts and everything linked to them.

* *Best way to avoid it*: Use an authenticator app as part of the 2FA process and disable SMS authentication.

**3. Clipboard hijack attack:** You get this from having malware on your device. If your device has been compromised with a clipboard snooper then an attacker can replace the crypto address you copied and replace it with its own address when you paste it (There are many forms of malware that monitor clipboard activity to detect if it contains a crypto address, then it automatically tampers with the receiving address)

* *Best way to avoid it*: Don't use pirated software, stick to legitimate operating systems, avoid illegal streams or questionable websites where you can get this type of malware. Use both an anti-virus and anti-malware program, do regular updates/scans and keep your OS updated to the latest security patches. Always double &amp; triple check the address you are sending your funds to.

^(\*1, 2 and 3 can easily be avoided by storing your crypto in cold storage (hardware wallet) where you have to confirm and authenticate every transaction.)

**4. Airdrop scams:** Airdrops are a legitimate way for new crypto projects to promote the launch of a new coin and boosting recognition for their token by distributing it to active members of a blockchain community. Unfortunately, sometimes they are scams, and the tokens cannot be transacted or swapped in any of the popular exchanges, asking you to claim them by going to a questionable site where they ask you to connect your wallet, input your seedphrase or send them gas fees in order to get them.

* *Best way to avoid it*: NEVER give your private keys to anyone or input your seedphrase to claim anything, always double check the legitimacy of the site where you connect your wallet, check [https://airdrops.io/](https://airdrops.io/) to see if the airdrops are legit. Spending money to make money doesn't apply here (Don't send gas fees in order to claim them, you won't get them back). And if something is asked of you, it will only be your wallet's PUBLIC address to see if you qualify.

**5. Greed scams:** A user 'inadvertently' and 'innocently' posts their recovery seed on social media, forums, reddit, etc. You being the 'good Samaritan' decide to recover your newly found wallet only to find out that you need to send ETH to be able to extract the ERC20 tokens, unfortunately for you as soon as you send the ETH there is an automated script that extracts it, leaving you ETH deficient and teaching you a lesson.

* *Best way to avoid it:* Don't be a greedy son of a bitch.

**6. Double your money scams:** A fraudster (maybe someone impersonating a famous person) asks you to send them 1 coin in order to get 2 coins back. Do I really need to explain this one? once you give away a coin, you should expect nothing back.

* *Best way to avoid it:* Ask yourself, would you give away 2 bitcoins in order to receive 1 bitcoin?

**7. Token scams:** Believe it or not, anyone can make a Token in less than 10 minutes and for less than $10 bucks, there are actually many apps out there that facilitate the creation of one. Because of this ease, there are many malicious contracts and rug pulls associated with the newest tokens on the market.

* *Best way to avoid it*: Go to [https://tokensniffer.com/](https://tokensniffer.com/) where you can check for yourself if the latest Token that was shilled to you is a scam.

brpintos,1635118379,"Am I the only one who feels that all this NFT craze ain't gonna age well..?  
Let me elaborate, and remember, we are not discussing here the fundamentals of NFT's. NFT's will certainly have a place because of what they can offer, and because they're a better mousetrap, but hear me out;  


This all started with crypto art. All of a sudden all these youtubers start to dump video after video on NFTS and how this represents the great new opportunity, hyper gains, 100x, yada yada.   
And well, because misery loves company, crypto punks happened, bored apes happened, and a bunch of other ones. These ""black swans"" helped crystalize the idea that NFT art was an incredible investment.  
And although I'm far from being an expert on everything crypto, I know my ways around design and art, and that's why all this felt funky from the get-go.   
The art business exists since ever. And every one can buy art. Also, digital art business exists since the beginning of the internet. What irritates me, is this narrative that NFT's all of a sudden created all of these. As if before, any of these was possible.  
This has nothing to do with art, art business or ""digital copyrights"" - bored apes and crypto punks went crazy because of the narratives, hype and fomo. There's no intrinsic value to them.  


And because only crypto rich can play this game (buying 100 eths bored apes), now, guys like tony jnyr and others are creating more stupid and cheap NFT collections so us, the ""peasants"" can get in on the FOMO too. All of these will worth absolutely zero in a year, which means, a permanent loss.  


And now, because Jpg's are too ""september"", it's the game industry. Again, the same pattern.   
This is what Backer posted today on twitter:  


*""Given the choice, most humans would dramatically alter their appearance, surroundings, communities.  This is why we will live in a digital world and our digital identities will be worth more to us than our RL.*    
*Nfts are the first phase of ‚Äúdigital‚Äù self.""(*

This is just stupid and annoying. NFT's aren't the beginning of nothing in the game industry. Every single problem that nft's could solve, is already solved. Yes it can be faster and cheaper, and more robust, and cool, but that's it. ""Oh because now you can create your own skins and sell them and;"" CS is doing that for a freakin decade. The nerve these guys have, saying out loud things, like they know something that no one else knows; including game companies who hires the most talented people in the industry on multiple areas of expertise.  


And speaking on Metaverse, the Metaverse exists in this  format since Second Life; this was 20 years ago. We already had ""lindens"" to trade for usd, make payments and earn money. Any of this is new, as the matter a fact is old af.  
And guess where's second life now? Nowhere.   
Before talking about NFT's and Metaverse, these guys should be questioning if there's a need and a want for this ""Metaverse"" they're always praying about. But that wouldn't generate many likes and views, wouldn't it?  
They take us for stupid with their cool catchy phrases and riddles on twitter. I can't stand these guys anymore and this NFT's crap.",CryptoCurrency,Am I the only one who feels that all this NFT craze ain't gonna age well..?

How can I send tokens from BSC network to Matic Network? Or is it just some type of scam? I am ready to pay the person who can help me with this. (I have tried a bridge but it only supports popular tokens)

In one of the books it explained that investors (i.e. hodlers) have 1 strategy. It is to hodl and when it goes down, just hope it gets back up. This kinda summed up my last bear market. Traders however are more flexible and can even make money in a down market (in theorie).

So I worked on a trading strategy and I tried to automate it to keep the emotions out. When i backtest the strategy on tradingview it shows some nice results. It even beats the buy and hold results.

I currently use 1/8 of the value of my portfolio for trading, but I have a feeling to double down. If we enter into a bearmarket at some point my flexible 1/8th part probably surpasses my portfolio, so why not increase it.

Kraken a rock solid exchange with beautiful design. It does nothing perfect but everything good. I like it and due to it being secure as hell, i trust them having even more of my funds on them.

Coinbase - also a rocksolid exchange (use pro for lower fees) It was my first exchange however kraken beats the shit out of it regarding fees.

1.) Break up whole Bitcoins into Satoshis. It's not enough that BTC is technically purchasable and divisible into millionths, but it should be displayed that way by default. 

Most people don't want to FOMO into a coin that costs $61,000 each, but when that's divided by a million?... Satoshis are only $0.061 each, with a maximum circulating supply of 21 Trillion coins!

Friday read an article from Business Insider about a Crypto VC fund that was making great returns by investing in Pre-Farming activities (should have been my first red flag ‚Äì because the ordinary investor like me does not have access). Rugdocs listed the site as ‚ÄúLow Risk‚Äù for a rugpull, so I decided that I wanted to try and earn a great APR from the onset of a ‚ÄúYield Farming‚Äù launch. I also knew that I did not want to risk a lot of $$, so, I went in with $350 +/-.

Site was on the AVAX network, so had some USDC that I spent on AVAX and sent to MM wallet and connected to the site. The safest investment that I could see was converting to wrapped DAI which was DAI.e. There was only one site that would convert the AVAX to DAI.e, Trader Joe (should have been my second red flag). And then depositing my DAI.e, the yield was 18,000% APR, but they wanted a 4% deposit fee (should have been my third red flag), but I moved forward with the transaction. As the site went live, and farming began, I noticed that when you ‚Äúharvested your yield‚Äù only 50% was sent to your wallet and 50% remained in your harvest amount until you were able to harvest again in 2 hours (should have been my fourth red flag). As the first 3 hours went by and I tried to capture great yields, the coin that was being harvested dropped from $3,400 to $430 and the yield went down greatly which was Tomato Coin (TMT), which also only had liquidity on the Yield Farming Site (definitely was my fifth red flag). After each harvest, there was a minimal gas fee to put the TMT token into my wallet.

üì∑

Even though Rugdocs.io listed the site as ‚ÄúLow Risk‚Äù, I became way since the APR yield was down from 18,000% APR to under 1,000% APR and the farmed coin continuously dropped hour by hour. I decided to pull my wrapped DAI out and convert it back to AVAX and then encountered not only a gas fee, but, a liquidity fee from Trader Joe (should have been my sixth red flag).

All in all, lost my 4% about $12, and gas/liquidity fees of $3 and AVAX price drop of $15. So, net net, my education cost me about $30. Moral of this story is, DYOR and I‚Äôll coin another acronym for crypto (RTFP ‚Äì Read The Fine Print), LOL.

However, not all is lost in this experience, included in my education was gaining the knowledge of how to set up an AVAX wallet, convert from AVAX X chain to C chain, send from AVAX wallet to MM wallet, connect to farm site, convert to wrapped coins, and play the yield game.

Lastly, do not be illusioned or have BIG Hopium on some of these projects, study them carefully ‚Äì even though I lost $30, I‚Äôm a lot wiser today. Reckon I‚Äôll miss a Happy Hour or two out with my buddies as a result üòä",CryptoCurrency,Yield Farming 101 Education - It Did Not End Well
CanChillorNoCanChill,1635110725," This is merely a theory of sorts. But in news a while back, A Crypto Whale purchased $43,838,916 USD of crypto token SHIB (9/30/2021). Being a bag holder of roughly 6 Trillion SHIB (6,178,758,122,373 tokens) 

Now If this anonymous individual resides in the USA, and were to pay Capital Gains taxes. It is possible for this one individual to pay off US Governments debt. Which currently is above $28 Trillion.

To make things easier, let‚Äôs just stick with the Federal Short Term Capital Gains tax of 37%. (Basically anybody whose Income is over $523K\~). And for the purpose of this theory, we will just sell the whole bag. 

That being said the recent ATH $0.00004432 would have turned this person‚Äôs $43 Million into $273 million. And if cashed for USD, would pay $129 Million in taxes ($128,940,285).  

If the market price is $0.00016185 it would make this $43 Million investment into $1 Trillion dollars. And be taxed at $397 Million ($397,630,435)

So what does the market price of SHIB need to be for this person to pay 28T in taxes? 

The market price of SHIB would need to be $0.0125. 

The total of this bag would become $77 Trillion (77,234,492,818) and when taxed at 37%, pay 28 Trillion ($28,604,380,860). 

This individual investor could literally wipe out most of the US Governments debt at that point. 

The Power of Crypto will move and change Governments.

|19|999|2.92|0.00|0%|
|20|LINK|1.81|29.32|1620%‚Äã|

As can be seen, simply putting $500 into BTC and $500 into ETH gain a remarkable results at $18,953. Or if you put $1,000 into ETH now you will be sitting on $29,729.

Diversification doesn't always work in crypto, though. The returns for top 5, top 10, top 20 are all lower than $18,953, hovering just around $10,000.

|$1,000 invested in|Crypto|
:--|--:|

|Top 10|$9,365.48|
|Top 20|$10,576.64|
|Best - top 20|$61,059.91‚Äã|

However, it is worth noting that one coin in the top 20 actually returns $61,060 (ADA). Some significant returns are also observed with BNB (3,261%) and LINK (1,520%). There is also a coin that is worth $0 today (999). If I dig through for lower cap coins back in 2020, I'm sure I can find some even more jaw dropping returns, however chances are huge that you might pick up a lemon or worse, a 999.

Now let's compare to another popular investment option.

**Stock**

Stocks of most major companies doubled in value in those 20 months. However returns on index such as NASDAQ or S&amp;P 500 are lower (67% and 40% respectively).

The largest outlier is Tesla. The $1,000 invested in Tesla stock back then would be worth $10,572.

I chose these for two reasons:
1. We all know where they are at today and we wouldn‚Äôt have suspected it in 2015. 
2. I hear a lot of people saying to others things like, ‚Äúdo you really think _____ coin will surpass BTC?!?!‚Äù

August 2015 - ETH

$1.26 x 72,000,000 circulating = $90,720,000 MC

$227.18 x 72,000,000 = $16,356,960,000 MC


August 2015 - BTC

227.18 x 14.55M circulating = $3,305,469,000 MC

So by the same 2021 logic, a person could have grabbed $100 worth of ETH at $1.26. At the time BTC was at $227.18. They would have dreamed their ETH hit the same BTC price. 

Would Reddit have swooped in and told them how crazy they were to think it would be greater than BTC? 

If not, then why is this a metric to valuation future value?

I have about $6000 in Fantom currently, it's sitting as collateral on geist.finance . I'm very happy with Fantom but kind of disappointed in geist. I wouldn't deposit there again if I had the choice but it's tied up in collateral and too expensive to try and move at this point. I need to pump in enough fiat to but out my loan so I can move it.

I have about $7000 staked in Wonderland Time. It's the most exciting thing I've found in crypto. It's either a life changing investment or the most I would allow myself to ever lose on a scam (5k buy in). Again, happy to discuss. (Full disclosure, the value of Time is closely tied to stakes, so I'm not objective) 

I have about $3000 in stablecoins. Mostly USDT. Why would anyone hold stablecoins? And as 20% of my portfolio too? Two reasons: First, that's the money I have already on ramped that is waiting for a good dip or buying opportunity to present itself. Second, I have it earning about 20-25%. The way that I am earning 20+% on stablecoins is via liquidity pools. Specifically I take USDT and add it to the USDT/USDC/DAI liquidity pool on avax.curve.fi  Liquidity pools create a trading platform for people that need to swap from one token to another. Double stable/ triple stable pools are my personal favorite for holding assets because they don't have a risk of impermanent loss. Your assets are used and people pay a fee to the LP and you get a share of the fee. In this case curve is paying 4% APY directly  and an additional 20% in AVAX to people that fund that pool since it's in demand. Since I believe in the long term value of AVAX I am holding that income. If I didn't have faith in AVAX I would just cash it out.

ArtofZed,1635106266,"As Bitcoin continues its October rally, news from the regulatory world is also creating bullish sentiment. Neither the SEC nor the IMF are calling for a crypto ban; instead, both organizations are advocating regulation. Good news is also coming from Germany and the President of Ukraine remains a crypto friend as well. Last week's Regulatory ECHO.

**SEC chief opposes crypto ban....**

After China's crypto ban, the guardians:inside of the US financial system have to take a stand. Because after the head of the U.S. central bank Fed, Jerome Powell, already spoke out against a ban on cryptocurrencies, Gary Gensler followed suit last week. At a hearing before the U.S. Congress on October 5, the head of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) distanced himself from the approach of the government in Beijing. 

According to Gensler, regulatory efforts rather have an integrative task. It is important to ensure that the crypto space is integrated into the financial system, for example in terms of consumer protection and tax law. A ban on Bitcoin is also not within the SEC's remit.

Not only the SEC, but also the International Monetary Fund (IMF) recently took a stand on cryptocurrencies. On October 3, the organization published a report discussing crypto-related opportunities and risks for developing countries. On the one hand, the IMF acknowledges there that Bitcoin and blockchain technology open up potential for more inclusive financial services. 

However, according to the report, increasing adoption could also threaten financial stability in developing countries in the future. For example, if citizens prefer Bitcoin to local currencies that are weakened by inflation. In the long term, this would undermine the respective central bank and open up loopholes for tax evasion. To counter such capital outflows, the IMF calls for international standards in crypto regulation.

ArtofZed,1635106147,"Bitcoin ""from crimes"" will be auctioned on the website Justizauktion starting next Monday, 11:30 am.

The online platform Justizauktion of the North Rhine-Westphalian law enforcement agencies will auction bitcoin worth eight figures on Monday, October 25, 2021. It says on Twitter: ""Every euro that is withdrawn from criminal structures helps to weaken them."" 

In addition, the judicial officials will provide information about digital currencies even before the auction. For this purpose, Markus Hartmann, together with public prosecutor Andreas Br√ºck, will give a brief insight into the typical offense fields of cryptocurrencies. In addition, the two explain how the ZAC NRW deals with it. The website was not created specifically to auction bitcoin, but cryptocurrencies already have their own category on it. Other goods that can be purchased through the website include cars, cosmetics, electrical appliances, handbags, games and more.

We have not yet received an answer to BTC-ECHO's queries about how many Bitcoin are involved, how the judiciary will get hold of the seized Bitcoin and what will happen to the funds generated from the auction.

DetroitMotorShow,1635105284,"A lot of projects are just once again following the same pattern from 2017 when it comes to raising funds. Allocate an initial big % of funds to VCs, key backers at a ridiculously cheap valuation while the project is not even in the public eye, then build some of the features of the project (usually a website, a DEX or couple of pools/farms) and then create a big marketing hyped launch event, where around 10% of the project's tokens can be bought by the public. Meanwhile, 90% of the tokens are controlled by insiders and VCs who entered at 1/100th the price. 

&amp;#x200B;

[Price during deposit perion: $27. Price for VCs: 22c](https://preview.redd.it/uily92gf9gv71.jpg?width=1125&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=12a1516e1496dc9524064c4a49ed13484300e700)

This is nothing short of a scam, but this market always drags in the next sucker who thinks they can profit by becoming a ""long term investor"" in these projects, and get in ""early""

The only way this ends is with the early investors slowly but surely dumping their tokens that were acquired at a very cheap valuation on exchanges, while the price corrects 90-98%. 

Many times, terminology like ""vesting schedule"" or locked tokens is used just to confound the retail participants, to make them believe they wont get dumped on. There is a vesting schedule, so the early investors will baghold through a 90% correction right? Lol

There is not one single reason any long term investor must look at these projects. There are several distribution mechanisms in existence today that are much more fair, including stake drops, farm distributions etc where one can acquire tokens of new projects without donating their funds away to the team at a terrible valuation. 

Most of the VCs in the crypto space are pure predators. They give zero fucks if the project even survives or not, as long as they exit their investment with a ton of cheese on top. They can hardly be fussed about the late investors or users. This is the rather sombre reality of an unregulated market - the ones making the rules do it predominantly to enrich themselves.",CryptoCurrency,"VCs are getting into projects at 22c, and then dumping it to the public at $27 in a ""public sale"".

sonaldas110,1635100681,"I have some millions of SHIB in my bags. I made profit? No, not a significant ammount as I FOMOed and bought at previous ATH. So why am I making this post?

The reason is to share my perspective about this meme coin. First of all for the newbies who are having fomo, these are way too much volatile and risky, yes crypto is itself risky but it conveys the highest bar of that risk factor (for god sake don't ruin your health all time looking at the charts). I don't like this coin personally (ready for the downvotes) as I don't see any solid motive or practical use case rather than just hold and making quick bucks. These coins are literally being driven by the community power. The astronomical imagination of the coin going to the $1 mark. I mean seriously? 

Then shouldn't you buy or stay away from meme coins? I will say no, you obviously can make some small gains and this is not a financial advice but the best thing I love about these memecoins that it brings people to the cryptoworld as most of the times people are afraid/lazy to do research and invest, which is not good for the adoption. Who doesn't love memes and who don't want to ride the hype train? The doge hype literally brought a lot of people previously.

UnlistedSpecimen,1635100376,"There's an Italian movie called ""Escoriandoli"" starring a wonderful (but sadly underrated actor) called Antonio Rezza.

In this movie, one of the characters intepreted by Rezza is a punk from the early 90s trying to find a way to capitalize on his small salary. In his main scene, he's seen walking in the street talking with himself and counting some money.

The monologue goes something like this:

""10 thousand, 20 thousand, 30 thousand... when I'll reach 2 millions, I'll buy 2 million cans of canned meat and I'll sell them to famiched populations for 6 millions. With those 6 millions I buy 6 millions lighters and then I resell them door-to-door with a gross gain of the 38%. With the net 38% I buy the gross 70% of the stock exchange and I resell it to the gross populations of North-Africa with a maximum rate of 22% and a minimum limit of 2%, with that percentage unbundled from the figure determining its value I buy the Strait of Gibraltar"".

I have a week of vacation ahead of me. What I planning on doing anyway, was trying to get a better umderstanding of finances in general, and markets and some TA in particular.

crua9,1635098939,"Long story short, this was the first year I was able to use bots. I wanted to see how well they would do vs natural trading.

What I found is it does make money, but unless if you have a ton to start with then it honestly isn't worth it. With tax tracking software, trading fees, and fees for the bot. It basically isn't worth it unless if you can make a ton of money with about a 5% ROI per month. (basically its a good tool for the rich. Not so much the poor)

Now here is where it gets nasty. If you're poor like me, then you can't afford a $40k CPA. This means you're stuck using some tracking software and that is it. The problem comes in with them being universal with LIFO or FIFO. From my under you can switch from LIFO to FIFO to LIFO sell to sell. But since the tracking software is universal this means you now have to pick one or the other. And sadly you have to stick with it or sell everything at the end of each year.

Selling everything automatically resets the long term timer (which you need to hold something for 12 months or longer to get into that anyways).

(FIFO is first in first out. It basically says what you're selling is reflected of your oldest stuff. So if you bought 100 something in 1990 and 100 now. Then sold 150 something tomorrow it will say 100 of that is from 1990 and the rest now. Which means 100 of that is long term tax bracket and the rest is short term. It basically is the reverse for LIFO last in first out.)

Anyways where the problem comes in is when you buy a given coin to hold. You later set a bot on the coin. With FIFO you could be seen as taking massive losses and gains. Since you can only deduct $3k in loss a year this means you will have to pay massive taxes gains you don't actually have due to how the bot and FIFO mesh. Running it through LIFO fixes this.

So where the big problem comes in is if you stake, mine, etc and you decide to sell. It would be mark under short term gains. This in the USA is automatically a higher tax amount and with the USA if you made less than $40k a year in long-term then there is no federal tax. So this means while you're paying less in taxes now. You also pay more later for normal stuff.

So why quit using the bot at all? Here is where the big kicker is. Tracking software tends to cost more per transaction. Meaning you will have to spend at least w cents per sell on tracking software if you use Koinly, you have to pay the trading fees, you have to pay taxes, and so on. And when you're gaining about 10 cents to 20 cents per trade. You're cutting it extremely close. And the profits between that and just normal trading. Normal trading always pays a lot more.

IMO bot trading isn't worth it unless if you're trading with something like $100k or even $1m to put into the bot. Like even if you don't make any mistake in oh you use a bot on a coin you already bought at a higher value (which still you will run into this problem with the nature of things). You realistically need to make $40k a year just to pay a CPA because if you ever get audited. It will be a nightmare for someone in poverty to get audited over 10k transactions or more.

TLDR bots are a rich person toy.

Note I'm not a financial or tax advisor. This is just from my experience",CryptoCurrency,Something to note for those poor and wanting to get into using bots in the USA
plk8888,1635098885,"I have been trying out some Defi incentivised-for-180-days LPs which have 130-150% APR (not APY, APR ...) and have been consistently getting the daily return expected over the last few weeks. This would indeed mean, all other things being equal, that the return would indeed be 600% APY with the compounding I do daily with the returns. This just seems to good to be true. It overrides most IL scenarios and, since it's more predictable that just buying the same coins and holding them seems to be ideal. It just can't be this good, clearly. Apart from IL, the risks seem to be:

*  It's mostly inflationary tokens like Atom/OSMO and so there is a chance over 180 days that inflation just reduces the coin value so when I liquidate, there are more coins that are worth less.
* The APR drops as more people pile into the incentivised pools and this brings things down to staking APR levels quite quickly.

PasserottoDolcissimo,1635096919,"Hello everyone,

I‚Äôm new here and I have a question about some market data I wish I could find somewhere.

**-Short question-**

The data I‚Äôm looking for is the price at which every individual share of a stock or unit of a crypto was traded last time.

Also an aggregated indicator that calculates the ‚Äúsum of (each share \* last individual traded price)‚Äù would be ok. 

**-Detailed question-**

I would need this indicator to evaluate discrepancies in value of a stock or crypto. Indeed market cap, float and volume can be misleading indicators according to which shares they refers.

Practical example:

Let‚Äôs say a crypto (any shitcoin) is generated from nothing and have a total of 100.000 units, now each unit is priced 1$ so the market cap is 100.000$. In detail 50% of them was never traded (0$ tot), 30% was traded long time ago last time at 0.50$ (15.000$ tot) and the rest 20% is actively traded nowadays at 1$ (20.000$ tot). Therefore the real ‚Äúacquired value over time‚Äù (AVOT) it is 0$+15.000$+20.000$=35.000$, and on average all the money put into this asset can support an average price of each unit of 0,35$ (against 1$ of the current price). 

The way AVOT changes is disconnected from any other classic indicator (market cap, volume, float, SMA, EMA, etc) because changes according to which individual units are moved.

Continuing the example let‚Äôs say that today 20% of the units are traded at market price (1$). This won‚Äôt change the market cap, float or average volume compared to the previous example. In case this 20% are the units bought at 1$ the AVOT won‚Äôt change and remain 35.000$. If instead the traded ones are from the pool of the 50% untouched units then it will become +20.000$+55.000$, and on average all the money put into this asset could support an average price of each unit of 0,55$ that is way closer to the actual price and therefore more reliable and solid.

Second scenario: let‚Äôs say that 40% of the units are traded during a selloff at market price of 0.5$. In case the units sold are half the ones bought at 1$ and half the ones bought at 0$ the market cap will become 50.000$ and the AVOT 30.000\*0$+20.000\*0,5$+30.000\*0.5$+20.000\*0.5$=35.000$. In the case instead the units sold are entirely the ones bought at 0$ the AVOT will be 10.000\*0$+40.000\*0,5$+30.000\*0.5$+20.000\*1$=55.000$, that‚Äôs even higher than the market cap that stays at 55.000$. 

Overall having the AVOT price would give me an idea on the fragility of the stock/crypto, telling me if the price I‚Äôm paying is close or far from the amount of money that globally and all time long people put in that asset.",CryptoCurrency,"Where to find the ""acquired value over time"" of a stock/crypto (if it exists)?"

awezumsaws,1635096315,"I'm not a financial advisor, and I only got into crypto in early May, but I am by nature a very driven-by-data person, so I've spent the last few months researching technical analysis of Bitcoin and meta analysis of the psychology of markets. What I will explain below is, I think, a fair, data-driven speculation, and I will acknowledge caveats at the end.

According to Elliot wave theory, we are in the 5th wave of a growth trend which historically has ended with Bitcoin having an increasing valuation from the 4th wave bottom at increasingly lower percentages of growth. This is easily seen in the ""[rainbow chart](https://www.blockchaincenter.net/bitcoin-rainbow-chart/)"" of Bitcoin's lifecycle. Here are the numbers (in USD, approximated for easier calculations):

* In the 4th wave bottom of 07/2013, Bitcoin fell to 69.70, then in 12/2013 rose to 1237.60 (1,775% of the 4th) before falling in 01/2015 to 166.50 (240% of the 4th) which was a 86.5% fall from the 5th wave peak
* In the 4th wave bottom of 07/2017, Bitcoin fell to 1826.20, then in 12/2017 rose to 19,891 (1,090% of the 4th, 61.5% of the growth of the same time period from the previous cycle) before falling in 12/2018 to 3215.20 (175% of the 4th) which was a 84% fall from the 5th wave peak

Extrapolating those numbers and the Elliot wave theory out to today, where 07/2021 was a 4th wave bottom when Bitcoin fell to 29,313, we should expect approximately 570% growth (60% of the growth of the same time period from the previous cycle) at the 5th wave peak which would have Bitcoin around 195,000 in 12/2021 before falling in 12/2022 to 46,900 which would be a 75% fall from the 5th wave peak.

Given that there is exponentially more institutional investment in this market cycle than in previous cycles, I have strong doubts that the next peak in the Elliot wave will be only 570% of the 4th wave bottom and that the next fall will be 75%, so here are some speculative correction percentages:

* At 500% of the 4th wave bottom and 70% correction, Bitcoin would rise to 205,000 and fall to 55,500 (190% of the 4th)
* At 500% growth and 60% correction, Bitcoin would fall to 74,000 (250% of the 4th)
* At 570% growth and 70% correction, Bitcoin would fall to 55,500 (190% of the 4th)
* At 570% growth and 60% correction, Bitcoin would fall to 74,000 (250% of the 4th)
* At 600% growth and 80% correction, Bitcoin would rise to 205,000 and fall to 41,000 (140% of the 4th)
* At 600% growth and 70% correction, Bitcoin would rise to 205,000 and fall to **61,500** (210% of the 4th) - we were at that number this week
* At 600% growth and 60% correction, Bitcoin would rise to 205,000 and fall to 82,000 (280% of the 4th)

As you can see from this wide array of calculations, the inevitable major correction cycle will bring us back down to a level that we have already recently seen or are likely yet to see in Q4 2021. I share this because it is helpful for me to mentally prepare now for the psychological blow of seeing numbers like ""195,000"" slowly turn into numbers like ""60,000"". I was certainly psychologically unprepared to see 64,000 turn into 29,313 or see my ""buying the dip"" of ETH at 3,990 turn into 1,721 which old-timers in this market will surely tell you was nothing they hadn't lived through before. May we all keep our heads about us through the remainder of this cycle and beyond.

Caveats:

* One major caveat to this speculation is the possibility that COVID-19 in 2020 introduced a false downward trend into the Elliot wave which would mean we are not actually in the 5th wave of the pattern but the 3rd. In this case, my extrapolations are meaningless as it is impossible to forecast what impact an economic crisis from a global pandemic has done to the market cycle.
* Due to the lengthening cycles of this market (see the rainbow chart) and market capitalization, it is also unlikely to see the rapid growth in a mere 2.5 months as I indicated. However, the Elliot cycle runs independently of the calendar, so the 5th wave could easily run well into 2022, and the correction/fall run well into 2023, but the numbers themselves would still play out. I happen to believe this is actually what will happen, again given the institutional investment and market capitalization in this cycle.
* And of course I, like everyone, don't know shit about fuck, so take all this with a few grains of salt

Final speculation: I also believe that when we see the correction at the end of this cycle, it will occur largely in parallel to a major correction in the US stock market. There will be a period of time (late 2022 to early 2023) when the decreasing value of the US dollar due to inflation will be less than the decreasing value of both stocks and cryptocurrencies, so there will be a pullout from both markets. When the dust settles, the crypto market will be globally recognized as the safer investment, and by 2025-26 we will see stability enter the crypto market that has not yet been seen, eventually leading to a flattening of the rainbow chart and the end of the US dollar as the global standard in the early 2030's. Then, the ""crypto market"" will cease being just that, and the different market sectors - tech, pharma, real estate, insurance, etc - will become sectors within the crypto market itself as those industries migrate operations to blockchain and adopt cryptocurrency payment systems. All this final shifting will rise out of the next correction cycle of the current Elliot wave which is years away, perhaps more than a decade away. If you entered this market when I did and got smacked in the face almost immediately but hung in there, it's ok.

**Tell me have you seen the glorious Hamster?**

Having witnessed this sub's commentary on the legendary crypto-trading hamster that generated significant gains, I sought out to get my own hamster. As I don't have enough time to invest in a pet, and because I wanted to practice my currently-shit coding skills, I opted to create my greatest invention yet: Hamster++, the robo-hamster that gives you financial advice (this is not financial advice) on what crypto to buy based on the highest quality random number generators.

&amp;#x200B;

**Random Number Generation**

In modern computer software, randomness is not truly random. To account for this inherently nonrandomness  within our random number generators, we call them pseudo (like, but not exactly) random number generators, or [PRNG](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pseudorandom_number_generator)s. The big thing with these good-enough random number generators is that if you know the starting value for the algorithm (the seed), you can effectively predict the generated sequence -- this is unacceptably nonrandom for my purposes.

Luckily, smart people with good reasons to be interested in PRNGs came up with a solution for this. They needed good random number generators to develop algorithms for important things like encryption, so they created advanced PRNGs that they properly named *cryptographically secure PRNGs, or CSPRNGs*.

The Python programing language enables you to make use of these advanced algorithms in its ""secrets"" module, intended for important things like password generation n shit. My dumbass used to to enable the most random selection of a crypto from a list (currently contains Coinbase Pro's listings).

&amp;#x200B;

**The Code**

If you're interested in the robo-hamster, you can get the code and resources off my github page here: [https://github.com/Adri6336/hampp](https://github.com/Adri6336/hampp) . Since this is my actual github, Imma use this here throwaway account. All scam messages sent to me will be ignored, mostly because I'm broke af and don't actually have any crypto to get stolen.

In order to run Hamster++, you'll need to have the latest version of [Python](https://www.python.org/) installed. Also, I made this on Linux, so the gui may look a lil wonky for Windows users -- I haven't had the opportunity to test it on Windows 10 yet",CryptoCurrency,"Since we can't all afford a high quality hamster, I decided to make one"
Upsilon_psi,1635095012,"Let's be honest for a second, the current crypto market is a shit show. It is basically a big ass Casino coupled with social media popularity contest. Having more people buy crypto and NFTs is not necessarily crypto/blockchain adoption. 

The way I see it, adoption means using the technology in our day to day life to provide a service and add value. It is not about buying low and selling high (or the most used strategy: buying high and selling low).

What's happening right now is playing a monopoly game on a Global scale. Think about it this way:

* If tomorrow, crypto just suddenly disappears, will that affect you life or the economy is any way? (other than the suicide hotline going crazy)
* How many are actually using crypto for paying for goods and services in such a way that FIAT money can't provide?
* How many are actually using NFTs for real life uses such identification, supply chain or protecting real work assets?

In other words, it is just transferring money from normal people to whales (and few early adopters). 

Some people might argue that this helps people learn, but unfortunately the contrary is happening. Most don't want to learn, they just want to buy a shitcoin with gazillion zeroes and ride it to the moon. That's why you can see a copy paste code with no use case what's ever having more 10x of proper innovative project with a development team and actual vision.

From what it seems, the majority are joining the hype and teaching other ignorant people wrong information, and for that it is a norm now that (these are just to list a few):

* Reflections = staking
* Decentralization doesn't mean shit
* Market cap doesn't mean squat
* a copy paste code/wallet/program is innovative if you say it loud enough 
* all coins are the same
* The worst of all, a scam project with so many red flags is being nominated for at least 4 award categories in a blockchain conference (I am not gonna name, if you know, you know) just because it has a cult. Which means, even the people who organize a blockchain summit can't even analyze transactions on a blockchain.

I believe in what crypto can bring, I hold it and will continue holding and I am actually in it for the tech (and the gain obviously). But I would prefer a sustainable slower gain that will continue, than a pump and dump scheme (which will be the case if the majority are into it just to make profit and scam the next guy).

24KSPECTRUM,1635094892,"**Hello everyone. I wanted to share with you some tips I have picked up on my NFT journey!**

**When starting an NFT project it is super important to develop a strategy and a future vision. If there is a weak strategy or future vision, you can forget the rest. Your community loves when you have a plan and a story to tell. To develop a proper vision, you can ask yourself these three questions.**

1. **WHY -**¬†WHY are you doing what you're doing? Are you doing it for the art? are you doing it for the community? Both? What's your story? Why did you get into this in the first place? These questions are fundamental when developing a marketing strategy and it gives people something to hold on to when first joining your community. People love stories, and if you can tell them a good story from the beginning, they are much more likely to hold on to your project! Tell them a bit about yourself, how old you are, your background, and why you're doing this in the first place.
2. **WHAT**¬†\- This is where you demonstrate WHAT you're doing, how you are creating value for your community. Here, you will explain your vision and future plans and where you are going with the project. Here you could also explain how your art process works and what makes it valuable for the investors. In this part, you will give people a reason to stay in your community and make them curious about your project and believe in your future value and what you are doing.
3. **HOW**¬†\- How are you going to do all this? Here is where the marketing kicks in. Every great project needs a great community, and it doesn't have to be thousands of people. You only need a handful of hardcore fans who believe in your work and want to be involved. Hold on to these fans. Give them something that not everyone gets fx. Airdrops and exclusive giveaways, be creative! Create an exclusive whitelist where they get exclusive drops in the future and early access to all your mints. Interact with them and make them a part of your project and even ask them for help and where they want to see your project in the future. If you build a good foundation, your marketing will be so much easier since your fans will spread the word. Although you have built up a good community, you still need to do some external marketing yourself. Below are some ways you can use marketing to gain new investors and followers.

**MARKETING**

1. Do it yourself or hire someone from your community or online to interact in different NFT communities and tell people more about your project. There are a bunch of varying Telegram and Discor(d) communities where people are looking for new projects to get into. This is where you combine the WHY - WHAT - HOW model into a short pitch, and if it's good enough, it will most likely convert into new active followers. Launching a project can be overwhelming, so don't try to take over the world on your first day. Ask for help.
2. Be active on Twitter, post sneak peeks, interact with your Twitter audiences as well as your Discor(d) community. Talk with them, ask them how they are doing, be honest, and never lie about anything or give false hopes. This is a crucial step to build up trust and be relevant. One false promise can take your project down, so be careful!¬†
3. Collabs, this is probably one of the best ways to market your selves in our opinion. Find projects similar to yours and ask for a collab. This is super effective BECAUSE if they already love the other project, they'll likely love yours. In our experience, this has gained us the most amount active followers.¬†
4. ADs this can be effective, but also, you could potentially spend LOADS of money with almost no conversion. Beware of this option since finding the right group to target can be a struggle.

This is a long-term game! Most projects don't gain hype overnight, so keep going and don't lose hope. If you believe in your art and have some people in your community who do as well, you probably have something special in your hands. Remember, projects don't need to sell out on the first day to be successful, and there will be some people on the way that will try to drag you down.

**Mistakes that we made and you should look out for!**

Be careful and judgmental when hiring an NFT promoter, both on Twitter and Discor(d). Especially beware of those who advertise them selfs as an NFT promoter. It may look like a good deal at first, with loads of retweets and likes, BUT most of these promoters charge a HIGH fee, and often you'll receive very few new followers, maybe 2 of them are active, and perhaps one of them slips into Discor(d). Ask them questions and be super judgmental. Otherwise, your budget will quickly burn up. If a promoter contacts you on Twitter claiming to be someone. Always ask them to contact you on Twitter through the account they're claiming to be representing.

Checking Grayscale website, GLDC is 64% BTC, 26% eth, 4% ADA 3% SOL and the other 3% in other various cryptos that may become something in the future.  It rebalances quarterly.  Nothing strange there.  I like the mix.  BTC is the store of wealth.  ETH is the transactional tool.  And others are incase they overtake.  

Anyway, at times, when ETFs or Mutual funds lack liquidity, they trade slightly above or slightly below net asset value.  Ive never seen a fund trade at more than 1% away from net assets.  I saw this on the website for GLDC for 10/22/2021.  Market price $32.44. NAV of Holdings $40.52.  Isnt that buying dollar bills for 81 cents?  What am I missing on this?  Some valuation info that doesnt' tie out? some FASB rule that requires them to state assets ABOVE NAV?   

Here are caveats on website

A lot of you might noticed that you can earn an interest if you stake or lend your money.

You might ask how long would it take to double the amount of your coins since that's something we all want, am I right?

Let me introduce the Rule of 72 to you then. According to that rule, to get an approximate time it'll take to double your investment is to divide 72 by the annual interest rate.

Now some examples to see it more clearly:

If your interest rate is 5 percents, it will take 15 years to double your coins.

With 8 percents, it would take app. 9 years.

Do you want to be faster and double your coins in 5 years? The rate should be then 14.4 percents.

Should you use compound interest on your coins? Definitely! Should you expect to double your $100, $1000 or $10000 in few months just from compound? Definitely not.",CryptoCurrency,Compound interest or how to earn money

1. Does it have any of the words: moon, mars, or bull in it? If so, it's most likely a scam.

2. Do they promise you 2x and up returns? If so, it's most likely a scam.

3. Did you learn about it on Reddit? Is there no other public information available about it on sites such as CoinGecko or CoinDesk? If so, it's most likely a scam.

4. Does their website not have links to a GitHub or other public repository for you to review their code? If so, it's most likely a scam.

5. Is their website informationally sparse and lack actual substance? If so, it's most likely a scam. 

6. Do they require you to lock your coins/tokens without being able to sell them? If so, it's most likely a scam. One caveat to this is that there are reputable and long term projects that do require staking. If a new project requires you to lock your assets, then chances are the creator will end up selling after you pumped up the price.

7. Is there not a clear fundamental use, service, or some sort of problem that they are trying to solve other than to ""moon shot""? If so, it's most likely a scam.

The more items that the questionable coin/token hits on the list above, the greater the chance its a scam. Keep in mind that there are some legitimate projects that might hit one of these items, so use this as a guide and a moment to take a breath and think before you spend.

A lot of you probably know that CMC emails got leaked, but no passwords etc. Even if that is true, your email is enough to cause trouble!

Email phishing:
You will 99% receive spam emails that will try to phish your information for exchanges or banking. Don't fall for this. Do not open any email that you didn't use to get before the leak. Do not open any link that might say something about your wallet or your exchange. Always double and triple check the email addresses that send you the email and even then make sure the content of the email is safe.

Social Media:
If you used the same email for social media accounts, they might try to get into them. You should change your passwords and if it bothers you even more, make a new email for your social media.

Exchanges:
If your email got leaked and it is associated with any exchange, change your passwords and even change the email too. Enable 2FA, preferably with an Authenticator.

JustAd2122,1635092073,"Hi guys,

Couple of days ago I have been offered to buy into a shitcoin (which I won't name since it is not the point) and I have been wondering since how does it really work (creation and swap), how is the price being decided, how can one manipulate the price and why it is commonly said that you will not be able to sell the coin to get your money out.

Since I don't plan on making such a scam I don't want/need to go too deep in the subject and get all the technicity so if someone can explain/participate/give his/hers opinion I'm very thankful !

1. How does it really work?
To buy into said shitcoin you simply have to copy the contract address displayed on CMC or Coingecko and add it to a swapping plateforme. However, if you search for the coin in itself on a swapping plateforme you can't find any pool for it. So how can you swap it? Are the tokens locked into the smart contract and when you send some Eth to this address you get said amount of SHTC (for shitcoin)? Or is the smart contract actually a pool in which the creator of the coin has added both ETH and SHTC after creating the shitcoin ? If it is the first answer, then how the price evolves ? For price manipulation, I guess the creator just have to buy more of the coin when he wants it to go up. But in that case, isn't it possible to follow the transactions on the explorer and see if they all come from the same wallet/a wallet that has interacted with the same addresses over time, linking it to the owner ...?

2. How will you lose money?
If the coin gains in value because your friend has been very good at pitching it, you want to sell out and get your Eth out of it, some say there can be scenarios that there wouldn't be enough liquidity for that. But if the pool (/smart contract?) has been used for buying it, the price should be the direct image of the imbalance of tokens in the pool, hence you should be able to get tokens out on the other side by selling. Okay, your selling power will probably balance the price back to a neutral (or below original price) at some point but since you are not the only one who swapped, you should be on the safe side if, let's say, the coin went 10x, 100x or 1000x. No ?

I'm asking this second question because the price went 5-10x quite fast and I was wondering if investing a small amount of money just to double it wouldn't be a very easy and safe way of making money if you stay realistic. Like putting 1k and getting 2k out in two days, that's a pretty good job ü§∑üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

So yeah, pretty long post for not so much, let's hope it interest also other people and someone care to share some knowledge here!

It may have been the real App Store but I'm really not sure. I swiped through the highlights of the app but I *did not download it* and instead closed whatever I was in.

After I closed, I saw that there were several apps that had downloaded by themselves. These weren't any nefarious apps, but just apps that I had once used and then deleted - such as games or things like that.

Anyway, since my wallets and exchanges are on my phone, I'm scared to open them now for fear of letting in a hacker to see my assets etc. As far as I know, all my funds are still where they should be.

Like the faults of certain economies or the US inflation or... well, anything else that might be going wrong in the world and that is even slightly related to crypto.

And the comments (at least the first wave) always seem to be the same thing.

""Crypto can fix this!""

We're all big on crypto and its possibilities, that's why we're here, but let's try to remember the limitations it has and not just praise it endlessly like a cult and offer it as a solution to literally everything, from inflation to world hunger to curing cancer.

As a small example with the US inflation thing, how exactly would crypto be able to ""solve"" that, other than give a certain number of people a way out of dealing with it while others inevitably suffer the effects nonetheless? Remember, crypto is a zero sum game in some regards.

NightCloud-,1635091587,"Hi,
I'm looking for advice. I've been in crypto for a couple of months. I started in March of this year thanks to a friend. Following his advice I bought some coins from top 20 by market cap, mainly Ada and Vechain. In May I was very scared to buy some more because of the crash, but thanks to you guys I did and I've been rewarded. I bought Eth at ~2k (my best investment so far, really proud of that one) and I also DCA'ed my other coins. As time passed and I saw my portfolio grow, I started to watch a lot of crypto related content on Youtube. I love 2 channels in particular: IntoTheCrytoverse and Coinbureau, and I watch them daily.

Now that we are in a bull run and everyone is excited about the new ATH's of BTC and their favorite altcoins, I want to invest big. I am looking for a coin or maybe a couple, that will do well in the next couple of months (end of the year or even further into Q1 or Q2 of next year). My choise stopped with ethereum as it was my best investment so far and because I really do believe in the project and I don't see any other projects beating the smart contracts king anytime soon. I am now asking for your advice as you guys didn't disappoint me so far.


P.S: I understand the risks of my decision and if the market were to drop tomorrow and we would enter a bear phase I do believe that we would eventually grow back and make new ATH's, even if it takes a couple of years. I am confident that I wouldn't sell any of my coins at a loss because I don't need that money anytime soon and  I have a stable, well payed job.

paulrudder,1635090523,"Hey guys, a while back I used BNB on Pancake Swap to buy a poocoin called WIFEDOGE. I did it purely to experiment with how to use the app and didn't put much money in at all, but I still managed to turn $15 into like $4.

Last month I decided to convert it back to BNB, so I approved the transaction and then on the confirmation screen it indicated that after network fees I should have walked away with abkut $2.50 in BNB... but the final transaction amount under my history in Trust Wallet is $0. Not sure if it was a scam, if i did something wrong, or if there wasn't enough liquidity, but the $2.50 just vanished. I even pulled it up on BSCScan and it showed the $2.50 supposed value but then at the bottom said $0 as total value after the transaction processed. 

Even stranger is I noticed today while importing my data to Koinly that I still have some WIFEDOGE left in my trust wallet balance (even though I had told pancake swap to ""sell"" / swap the max amount possible when I did the transaction last month). 

So I was going to try to do another conversion to BNB to totally clear out the remaining balance of this shitcoin and get it off my portfolio, but it's showing $0.56 in network fees and a total earning of $0. I am so confused. Here are screen shots:

http://imgur.com/a/ohdFSDM

If my total value is $0, then where is the network fee being taken from? If I don't have any value for the transaction, where is it going to pull the $0.56 from? Because to me it looks like there is nothing to deduct it from? 

And my other question...Is there *any* way to get rid of the remaining WIFEDOGE or is this some kind of liquidity issue / do I just have to let it sit there in my account?

FutureIsCrypto,1635089460,"As I was reading the front page this morning, there was a particular comment that really hit me. I don't remember who it was but they said something along the lines of ""***how we feel about SHIBA-INU's growth and how it is fundamentally, is the same way how non-crypto people view us***."" This hit me like a train in that it rings very true. Think of how many people you have talked to about cryptocurrency (if any) and have questioned its use-case, legitimacy, value, etc. Of course, some will agree and that's awesome. However the ones that don't agree will later go on to spread ill-will towards crypto because they have missed out and most likely are somewhat jealous. I will admit, I still struggle with this from time to time. 

For us, we viewed Doge and SHIB as meme coins who were supposed to be nothing more than a pump and dump or, just speculative fun. I think for most of us, we feel somewhat jealous that the hours we spent researching our coins were in vain as we see coins such as these rise significantly in value while our coins are down. In the back of our minds I think we all wanted to take a small chance on them but were too hesitant to invest based on what the majority of people were saying here. Instead of the ill-feelings towards the people who have made some nice gains, we should congratulate them on their success and having some **diamond balls** lol. 

Look back at when you first entered the cryptoverse. You took a speculative chance, gamble, risk, or however you want to word it against what the majority of people were telling you. Chances are, you have done pretty damn well up to this point. It's no different than what people who have invested in Doge or SHIB have done. They went ***against the majority*** and came out on the other end a whole lot richer. In the end, our profits from any coin are most likely going to flow back into the market as we chase more gains. Unless you want to buy that Lambo, then as r/Wallstreetbets would say... fuck you and good job.

If we want to hit that 10 trillion dollar market cap for crypto as a whole, we need to be unified and hype each other up when gains are made or help each other out when we bleed from the rear.

But 100,000,000 x .01 is $1,000,000.....

This is how we are thinking.... Desperate to get out of poverty.. A prayer, and a dream.

I'm not endorsing shitcoins... But I am watching and a part of what is happening...

Then we start to see huge amounts of money being moved into these coins.... I'm talking $100's of millions of dollars...

The price spikes overnight..... 

Yesterday 10,000,000 shiba cost $280, today $410...

A few months ago you could get 100,000,000 shibes for this price....

The moderate conservative crypto invester at first... Laughs, then they mock, but after seeing 300-1000's% gain, they join in...

Market cap shoots up billions over night... 2 meme coins are in the top 15...

More money from the middle class and upper class join in...

Now memes are flying...

Poor people that put in a few hundred bucks are now worth $10,000- $100,000's... A few millionaires are made.

As the frenzy continues.... More zeros are dropped of the price... Now it takes more money to make less returns... But people are greedy.

Now a meme that way 10,000th of a penny are now 1000th of a penny.... More millionaires are created from a few $1000 investment.

It's happening before our eyes... We seen it with doge, from ..004 to .74 in less than a year.... Now shibe removed 2 zeros in a year.

Like it or not, but the great wealth transfer has begun... The rich and middle class are handing money over to the poor fist over fist...

The very rich are making 100-300% returns in bitcoin... While the poor are making 1000's-10,000's% on memes..

I'm not endorsing memes.... It's very risky... But I'm holding both doge n shiba... And am experiencing the shift directly...

I know there will come a time where they may disappear, maybe by the end of the 4yr cycle....

But in the meantime people are getting rich! Thank you FOMO'S.... And late comers.

Tl:dr

Meme coins are taking money from middle class, wealthy, fomo'ers.... And giving it to the poor via meme coins.",CryptoCurrency,Crypto currency... The great shift
awakenedcarrot,1635089052,"I'm not a tech analyst and crypto is completely random.  More than likely you will have fomo every day as rich people are trying to get rich doing the opposite of whatever you are doing.

If you want a reliable goal I would consider investing in functional alt coins.  Meme coins usually don't last past one or two pumps.  Currently I am invested in Proton,  and if you have the MetalPay app there are little to no fees from withdrawing.  I take out 50$ a day and I end up keeping 45.50.  Even better its instant transactions during business days so don't worry about the 3-5 day crap.  Also the Proton team will respond super quickly if you have an issue and email them.  They are also very active in r/Protonchain.

This is just a small example,  but crytpos like this are going to survive the long run.  Functionality is getting stronger too as the big coins show their flaws.  These types of coins are going to aggressively compete with each other,  and if you want a long lasting and solid community these are the ones to invest in.",CryptoCurrency,"Those of you upset about SHIB, functional alt coins will probably become popular again soon."

# What is it?

EOS is a blockchain platform designed to develop decentralized applications (DApps). Its operation is similar to the Ethereum platform, with the exception that it is faster and more scalable. It enable developers to build decentralized applications more efficiently. EOS is a project strongly focused on solving many of the problems of blockchain technology, especially from those who keep it away from massification and global adoption. To achieve this, it has a number of fundamental pillars to satisfy, they are:

* **Free use:** the platform must offer flexibility to developers and users to offer free services. This indicates a more widespread adoption of the technology.
* **Recovery from errors:** the platform must be robust enough to correct errors when they inevitably occur.
* **Sequential performances:** there are some applications that simply cannot be implemented with parallel algorithms due to sequential dependent steps. For this reason, the platform must support fast sequential performance.
* **Parallel performance:** large-scale applications need to divide the workload across multiple CPUs and computers.

# How does it work?

In this aspect, EOS is similar to Ethereum. The capabilities of both to enable distributed application development are immense. However, there are important technical points where EOS has some advantage.  Among these points are:

* Ability to provide accounts, authentication systems and databases.
* Asynchronous communication between nodes.
* Parallel application programming to exploit the potential of multiple CPU cores and / or clusters.
* High scalability.
* Elimination of fees and commissions.
* Quick and easy deployment of decentralized applications.
* Simple upgrade system.
* Error recovery.

Another important point is that it has a consensus protocol designed for high scalability. In developing EOS, the team decided to implement the **Delegated Proof of Stake (DPoS).** In this way, all those who possess EOS tokens will be able to choose to produce blocks thanks to a voting and approval system. Money production is permissive. That is, a user can produce blocks in proportion to the votes he accumulates. The network can produce one block every 0.5 seconds and batches of 126 blocks every time.

# Where to store it?

The best hot wallet for EOS are Scatter, EOS-voter, SimplEOS and Exodus If you want more security, a cold storage like Ledger is the right choice

# Pros&amp;Cons

\*DISCLAIMER\* These lists are subjective, it depends from person to person

**Pros**

1. High scalability
2. Great roadmap and devs team
3. Low transaction fees

**Cons**

1. Transactions are not anonymous
2. Not completely decentralized",CryptoCurrency,KnowYourCrypto #39: Eos (EOS)

lordofming-rises,1635088316,"Hello!
I have been considering just buying the top 10 coins per marketcap and this every month like 500 dollars with 25 percent for BTC and ETH and the other 50 percent for the 8 other coins.

With that I am expecting to have some gains at least on some coins and avoid FOMOing everywhere and instead I would do a check every end of month and sell the ones that didn't perform well  and rebalance for again the 10 new marketcap (removing tether and maybe take another coin like ONE or FTM that has also promising uptrend).

Now I wonder on which plateform doing that, because I have Jade card for Crypto.com and I have one or two coins on Binance and Kraken.

For me crypto.com seems easier because I usually top up anyway every months for my groceries on it so adding a little bit more would avoid me transfering twice. But the spread is shit. Is that difficult to transfert to exchange en then use exchange? 

What are your thoughts?  And is it wise my strategy or is it just plain dumb and I should go all in Shib (which soon will be on marketcap 10 aha)

Finally, I told myself ""if you weren't in the cryptoverse; you wouldnt even know shiba existed and you wouldn't feel like you're missing out"". That was enough.

kirtash93,1635087067,"Welcome to **Round 32 of the Cryptotrivial 2021 contest**!

# Question 32: A technical analysis indicator that measures market volatility. It's made of two sidelong bands and a simple moving average.  

The correct answer of **Round 31** is...

# Block Header!

**What is a Block Header:**

The block header is a section in a¬†block that serves as a summary of the rest of the block. It‚Äôs made up of all the¬†metadata ‚Äì such as the time and difficulty when the block was mined, the¬†Merkle root of the included transactions, and the¬†nonce. Also present is the previous block‚Äôs¬†hash, which is what allows us to create the ‚Äúchain‚Äù of blocks. In essence, the block header contains any data that isn‚Äôt the list of raw transactions itself.

A block header is what the miners hash to try and make the block valid. This is a lot more efficient than hashing the entirety of the block, which can be made up of thousands of transactions. It would be vastly more cumbersome for a miner to change the nonce and to rehash a whole 2MB block for every attempt. Compare this with hashing¬†Bitcoin‚Äôs block headers, for instance, which have a fixed length of 80 bytes.¬†

Block headers are great from a mining point of view, but because of their small size, they‚Äôre also ideal for¬†light clients. The Bitcoin¬†blockchain is too large for devices like smartphones to store. If the chain had 100,000 1MB blocks, you‚Äôd consume 100GB of space. But with just the block headers for those same blocks, you‚Äôd only take up 0.008GB, or 8MB.

In this way, devices with less bandwidth or storage space can still perform some degree of validation. Because the Merkle root encapsulates all of the transactions, they can later check whether a transaction was included in a particular block. This does come at a cost ‚Äì the user must still rely on a third party to provide them with necessary information. With that said, light clients are preferable to a system where the users perform no verification at all.

Jasquirtin,1635086711,"As shib is pumping we have many new people entering the space from their favorite YouTuber or person on Twitter telling them to buy shib. And it sure as hell is working to this point congrats. 

But the problem is many of you newbies don‚Äôt understand MC I just got flamed for pointing out to two people that shiba will not EVER hit a penny (.01). I was accused of it being just like BTC to 10k and doge to 50 cent. Okay no shib is like neither of those. 

Let‚Äôs revisit market cap shall we? The market cap is a metric we use to compare coins to one another it‚Äôs THE thing to check when you want to know potential price action of a coin. MC= circulating supply x current market price. BTC is the #1 coin at 1.1T (1 decimal place) MC. You can calculate that with $60,300 (current Market price) x 17 million (circulating supply). No one with a brain should believe your coin will surpass this. 

Let‚Äôs look at shib shall we. A current MC of 17 billion. It‚Äôs got some room to run sure. Will it get to a penny? No shot. Why? MC. To get to 1 cent shib will need to 238x from here. That would be a market cap of 17B x 238 = over 4T. All of crypto is currently 2.55T. It‚Äôs NOT HAPPENING THIS RUN. 

If you are new I hope this helps cause I doubt your influencer who told you to buy explained this. If you made money great but no your $50 will not 300x you will not hit $1 the supply continues to go up daily making it even harder. I hope this helps.",CryptoCurrency,A reminder Shib will NOT hit 1 penny
BradlyL,1635086679,"Like many, when I got into crypto many years ago, I was personally attracted to the idea of a decentralized network, which isn't owned by an elite few, or some middle-man.

Today, it seems the average newcomer has little to no interest in this principle. Moreover, I find it interesting that many who've even been interested/invested in cryptocurrency, continue to show minimal interest in some core principles of economics, such as: Market capitalization, 'Tokenomics', reading a whitepaper, trading/investment principals....and possibly most disturbingly **Distribution of Tokens (wealth)!** 

Imagine for a moment a small elite group of 100 people, in control of assets used by millions. Able to manipulate the market at will, and cash in on their centralized game at any time...Its a scary fate to imagine, especially if you're one of those players in their game.

The truth is that this isn't imaginary....it's quite literally what the current cyrpto market looks like...

Enter, **Shiba Inu....Where 82.14%** of all tokens are owned by just 100 people! 

Or even worse **Binance...Where 98.8% of USD coin** and **95.57% of Binance Coin** is owned by the Top 100 holders.

I know what you're thinking...another post shaming SHIBA, blah, blah, blah....Well, you're right. But, they're not alone. Let's take a look at some of the other most popular crypto currencies, and how they match up (w. sources):

Jlin153,1635086629,"Now, I usually don‚Äôt ever post on this sub but I just check on it every couple of days. 

With Shib hitting a new ATH, it seems that many people in this sub are upset that the coin itself didn‚Äôt go crashing down and losing everyone‚Äôs money. But this confuses me because majority of people looked down on the coin instead of just taking a bit of lottery money and tossing it in for the heck of it like how everyone else is.

First, I would disclose that I tossed 300$ in the project around March. And I seen that grow to immense sense amounts and also fall insanely just as quick. Yes, I held despite looking at all the posts saying ‚Äúscam, rug pulls... etc.‚Äù but at the end of the day, it was just a experiment in crypto. The fundamentals are not as ‚Äúprofessional‚Äù or solid as other coins, but the coin has still delivered on its projects that it promised the people. Instead, people still called it a shitcoin.

Why do people let their pride get in their way of making money? Many companies know the coin has so much hype around it that it be foolish for them to not list it. The amount that was made from doge itself by robinhood was insane and I have a feeling the same can be said around this coin.

Just be happy for those that invested because they risked their money. And their money is just as hard earned as your money.

Now if you feel like you missed out, wait for the coin to stabilize or drop, and just toss some spare into it so that next time when it pulls the unthinkable, at least you are in it for the ride too.

The crypto world is still new. There is plenty of room to hold ‚Äúreal‚Äù projects and still play with ‚Äúshitcoin‚Äù. It is actually quite entertaining with the community.",CryptoCurrency,What‚Äôs with all the Shib hate?

WELL GUESS WHAT? YOU‚ÄôRE NOT OWED ANYTHING. You clearly saw the Doge run earlier this year, and have witnessed first hand how a coin with no fundamentals can launch itself to life changing amounts of money. Many people actually were drawn to crypto from this. At the end of the Doge run, I‚Äôm sure we all had a small hint of thought ‚ÄúSHIB would do something similar.‚Äù And if I‚Äôm being blatantly honest, I had a gut feeling that it would 100% have some type of run. But I didn‚Äôt put anything in myself either. And I am not complaining. You know why? 

Because if you go to my hometown, R/wallstreetbets, one that I‚Äôm sure we are all familiar with, you will see that they work with STOCK OPTIONS, much of which can make fortunes or losses overnight and has been literally equated to GAMBLING.

Jeronemoo,1635083629,"# Introduction

You've seen VRA or Verasity mentioned here and there, perhaps you've heard about their plight to defeat online ad fraud. People are hyped, but you don't really know what Verasity does. In this post I'm going to give you a quick overview of the problem they aim to solve and their solution.  
Summary at the bottom for those that dislike large posts.

# Which industry is Verasity aiming for?

The problem they aim to solve has everything to do with the online ad tech industry. In a single sentence: 

&gt;Online ad tech industry, or online AdTech, refers to a network of interconnected technologies working to make sure the right people get the right ads at the right time. 

The online part is important, because the *online* AdTech industry is growing at an incredible rate. The online AdTech industry spending worldwide was calculated to be around [378 billion U.S. dollars in 2020, growing to an estimated 646 billion U.S. dollars by 2024](https://www.statista.com/statistics/237974/online-advertising-spending-worldwide/)!

So basically all the work that is done in order for you to see, and hopefully interact with, an ad, online. Ads on website, mobile phones, TVs, tablets, any digital device. All tools needed to design, build, serve &amp; maintain those ads.  
All of that, is the **online AdTech industry**.

[Seriously, there's a lot going on before you see an ad](https://preview.redd.it/9ke2y514iev71.jpg?width=1242&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f1782964ce6a7de1eeffd32d5ead42653c91eb79)

# Which problems does the online ad tech industry face?

Brands don't always know exactly where their ads end up, or who views them. Invalid traffic, [bots roaming around](https://www.anura.io/blog/what-is-a-bot-and-how-do-bots-impact-digital-ad-campaigns), is another issue. Basically, as a Brand, you have no clue what you're paying for, you lack insights, you don't know if you reached the target audience. A complete lack of transparency.

Lack of transparency and fraud go hand in hand. The fact is, that online AdTech is growing so fast that technology couldn't (or wouldn't) keep up with fraudsters. According to [Forrester](https://www.forrester.com/report/Poor-Quality-Ads-Cost-US-Marketers-74-Billion-In-2016/RES136115), as much as **64% of ad fraud** **happens in the video ads sector.** Here are [some more statistics](https://www.statista.com/outlook/dmo/digital-advertising/video-advertising/worldwide), to give you an idea of the issues brands face:

https://preview.redd.it/0bgbuxnljev71.jpg?width=1400&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=fe23dc229830ea3f93c5af146bef3047ebed9093

To quote a [speech](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NEUCOsphoI0) (worth it to watch) given by P&amp;G CBO Marc Pritchard in 2017;

&gt;We have a media supply chain that is murky at best, Fraudulent at worst.

 

All in all, the online AdTech industry has a whole bunch of issues, video ad fraud being the biggest one. That is the one Verasity aims to solve.

# How does Verasity aim to solve these?

We have established, above, that a lot of issues in the online AdTech industry stem from lack of transparency, we all know [blockchain](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/blockchain.asp) inherently has this transparency.

Verasity has developed an ad platform called VeraViews. This platform makes use of Verasity's patented Proof of View technology to solve the issues mentioned above.

**Proof of View**  
Proof of View (PoV) is a patented Verasity technology that uses artificial intelligence, over 200 touchpoints, and third-party detection vendor partners to determine whether an ad is actually viewed by a person or not, in real time. PoV analyzes the data gathered and determines if the ad view is valid or fake. A valid ad engagement (a person viewed the ad) is stored on the blockchain afterwards, where it can't be tampered with.

All of this is done with your privacy in mind; No personal linkable data is stored.

# The solution: VeraViews

VeraViews is Verasity's platform that uses PoV to solve the above mentioned issues in the online AdTech industry. It is a complete advertising system allowing brands to upload their ad campaigns directly to take advantage of publisher ad space on their sites.

That means VeraViews cuts out the middleman; Money spent on ads is split between those that create all the value.

That's not all, here's some more added value VeraViews brings to the table;

* VeraViews offers full transparency to all parties in the advertising value chain, privacy compliant.
* Thanks to PoV every ad view paid for is an actual ad viewed by a person, eliminating ad fraud altogether.
* Publisher can get paid right away, instead of waiting months on end.

Simply put, VeraViews is a platform that Brands can easily use to create their ad campaigns, publish them and control them, all the while granting them all the benefits mentioned above. If you're up for a more in-depth technical explanation, I'd suggest you read[ this blog](https://medium.com/verasity/veraviews-ad-tech-platform-roll-out-proof-of-view-4815ba5e71eb). 

# Summary

When did you hear about cryptocurrency, what was your first impression, what is your impression now and most importantly what event/coin changed your mind (if it changed that is).

I'll start:

A friend of mine was the one who introduced me into crypto back in 2013... Of course the coin he was into was Bitcoin.. I was immediately into it and was researching heavily.. my first actual investment though was in 2015.. and it was Litecoin... I purchased it at $3 and hold to it until 2017 , where I sold it for $54... I was a uni student at the time, and making an 18x on my investment was just.. unbelievable.. even as I was withdrawing the money I was still feeling like I was doing something illegal/wrong... Fast forward and i got to cry when it flewww to over $350 (and his big brother BTC over 19k).. and then feel like I dodged a bullet when it fell under $25.. After that , with uni life, and me losing interest, I didn't get into crypto again till October of 2020.. my next coins were dogecoin , which I honestly got just for the memes (bought over 13000 of them for $100 and another 100.000 of them for $2000).. and sold them for $14000... I've been holding MATIC ever since.. Polygon and it's network are just.. so appealing to me.. and i don't really see it going under the price I bought it for ($0.098).. So yeah, it will remain on staking, until I am satisfied with the amount and sell some of it.
No idea what my next coin will be, and how the crypto space will look until then, all I know for sure is I never see a time where I will ever NOT hold ANY crypto ever again.

heyheoy,1635078999,"Forty-seven bankers were sentenced to jail time for their role in the financial crisis, Financial Times research has found, dispelling the myth that no one was held personally accountable for the financial sector‚Äôs catastrophic failures.

The FT searched records and news reports from across Europe and the US to uncover how many bank employees and directors recieved jail sentences for issues directly linked to the crisis or the collapse of their institutions.

The data does not include traders and other bank staff jailed for their role in interest rate rigging, like the two [Deutsche Bank traders jailed](https://www.ft.com/content/c970a0c0-8b53-11e8-b18d-0181731a0340) for interest rate rigging earlier this year, or for rogue trading not directly linked to the crisis or a bank collapse, like UBS‚Äôs Kweku Adoboli, who is now [facing deportation](https://www.ft.com/content/3c77180c-a1a6-11e8-85da-eeb7a9ce36e4).

Iceland had far and away the highest incidence of jailing, accounting for 25 of cases. The country seized control of its banks in October 2008 and imposed capital controls which ran for eight years to stave off chaos.

Chief executives, account managers, traders and chairmen from four banks were sentenced to term of between six months and five and a half years for everything from market manipulation to ‚Äògross breach of fiduciary duty‚Äô.

Luckily for them, Iceland has some of the [plushest jails](https://grapevine.is/mag/articles/2011/09/27/doingtimeiniceland/) in the world, with an ethos framed around rehabilitation rather than punishment. Prisoners are allowed flat screens TVs up to 26 inches, personal computers and games, and can apply to leave as often as once a month after they have served a third of their sentence.

Eleven Spanish bankers were sentenced to jail time for issues relating to Spain‚Äôs 2012 banking collapse, [most notably Rodrigo Rato](https://www.ft.com/content/7f93082e-f9ed-11e6-bd4e-68d53499ed71), the former head of the International Monetary Fund who chaired Bankia in the run up to its collapse.

Ireland, where the ‚Ç¨67bn bank bailout bill forced the country into a sovereign bailout, jailed seven, but convictions of two bankers ‚Äî Bernard Daly and Tiarnan O‚ÄôMahoney ‚Äî¬†were later quashed.

The most controversial was the case of Aoife Maguire, a former assistant manager at Anglo Irish Bank who was convicted of ordering the deletion of records relating to the accounts of former chief executive Sean FitzPatrick. Ireland‚Äôs Court of Appeal ultimately found her eighteen month sentence was ‚Äúunnecessarily severe‚Äù, and shortened it to nine months, four of which were suspended.

The US, ground zero for the financial crisis, has jailed just one banker for issues relating to the crisis. Former Credit Suisse trader Kareem Serageldin was sentenced to thirty months in prison for artificially inflating the price of subprime mortgages, a financial product at the very heart of Wall Street‚Äôs unravelling.

And I didn't want to gift her jewellery, it just doesn't feel right to me somehow.
And after lots of thinking I finally decided that I'll gift her something that appreciates over time, and not depreciates, and might actually change her life down the line, unlike an iphone or a necklace. So, I decided to buy her a bitcoin (not a whole bitcoin ofcourse, I was in love, but not to that extent :-P). 
Thing is she's not at all into investments. So, one more reason behind gifting her a bitcoin was to introduce her to the world of investments, a world where she would rather have $1000 in stocks/cryptos, than an iphone.
So, I asked her to install Binance and get verified, so that I can transfer her her's bitcoin. (Before you guys starts judging ne, I feel my rationale behind the Binance selection instead of a private wallet should be self explanatory). 
And she's like, this is the most uncool gift ever. For a gift also you want me to do all the hardwork with downloading app, ID verification, and understand how things work? You SUCK!

- SHIB only NFT offerings are near or already launched (can remember which)

ObsoleteGentile,1635077260,"It‚Äôs 100% OK to FOMO into a memecoin, so long as:

1.	You truly understand what it is, and are aware the money could disappear forever.
2.	You understand and observe risk management.

That‚Äôs it. Crypto is a way to enhance your future wealth and advance your retirement date. Play intelligently and responsibly and you will probably do that.

But it‚Äôs also pretty fun and exciting, especially for newcomers to the investment world. So why not have some fun, and take a small, non-life-changing moonshot now and then?

I‚Äôm not talking about risking half your portfolio, or even 10%. This is where the risk management comes in. Try maybe one or two percent of some recent gains. For example, say your responsible investments have made you $50K over the last two years. Feels good, right? Would $49.5K really feel that much worse??

That‚Äôs why during the DOGE run earlier this year I threw in 500 bucks, over a couple of buys, including one brief margin play. Worst case scenario is I‚Äôm out 1% of gains that were already‚Ä¶well, gains. House money. The play worked and I got out at the right time.

Had I invested everything, I‚Äôd be faced with the daily decision of which Aston Martin I would drive to look at new mansions. But no, it didn‚Äôt change my life. It gave me over $4000 in free money, though, and stopped me from feeling like I had entirely missed out on a big deal. I immediately put $3000 of that into safer investments and kept the rest for other fun plays. Now I‚Äôve got a decent position on another shitcoin.

Even if that position is worth 5 figures now, I could lose it all by holding. But if I do, what have I really lost? Answer: 25% of 1% of some gains I made in my much larger positions in more responsible investments. And the whole time those responsible positions have been there, poised for my future.

So while you‚Äôre perfectly free to say NO on principle to memecoins at any amount, under any circumstances, just remember: this decision is purely personal. You‚Äôre not hurting the meme coin by staying out, and you‚Äôre not ‚Äúhelping crypto stay respectable,‚Äù because no matter what you think, there are more than enough boneheads kamikaze-ing into shitcoins that your abstinence has no bearing.

\- Node controlled by anon dev team

\- Currency can be mined in toxic mines with shitty ethics and pretty shitty fellow miners

The joke here is that what I'm shilling you is simply the US dollar, or any fiat currency for that matter. All the skills that have come intuitively to you while researching a cryptocurrency, stuff like max supply, market cap, issuance rate, issuance proofs, hash functions, token burns, etc.? These are the sorts of skills that fiat dev teams wish you never learnt, because they know if you ever did, you'd be up in arms.

 *It is well enough that the people of the nation do not understand our banking and monetary system, for if they did, I believe there would be a revolution before tomorrow morning.* 

   *--- Henry Ford*

Those are just the skills you learned intuitively the first day into crypto. Those are just skills related to fiscal policies.

If you never studied economics or business or finances in university, don't worry, because when it comes to fiscal policies, most university only shove basic stuff down your throats and regurgitate the same bullshit that's been going on since the Nixon era. They simply tell you that this Keynesian method is the norm nowadays without telling you its flaws. They never explain to you why only 1 single node gets to control the amount of fiat mined. They never explain to you why dev team is mostly anon. They simply want you to accept things as they are and as they will always be. 

Cryptocurrency gives you the firsthand experience as to why things are bad the ways they were and that things don't always have to be this way.

**But what about other skills? Aside from fiscal policies, what else have you learned that you take for granted in crypto?**

Keep in mind that the majority of adult Americans are basically financially illiterate, and believe it or not, Americans already represent the peak of humanity's education. (In coming hurr durr dumb American jokes from Europeans for sure) But let's move on.

How many people do you know are dumb as rocks when it comes to money management? How many constantly take on debts, live way above their means, have no savings or safety nets, waste money on drug addiction, gambling and poor decisions?

Now let's see what crypto has taught us during the bootcamp courses:

DCA. Sacrifice today for a 1000x better future. Don't let banks steal your yields, take charge of your yields. Research into each crypto's portfolio. 

Plus other financial tools and concepts like: reading charts, margins, leverages, future contracts, intellectual property ownerships, cryptography, safe online hygiene, macroeconomics models, technical analyses, etc.

Unless you were already in stock before crypto, these concepts are completely foreign to you. The stock market has a higher barrier to entry than crypto, and the majority crypto people in their early 20s without any prior financial experience had to learn all these concepts themselves. Were it not for crypto, many of these people would have been stuck working a normal job, not giving a shit about the global money market or any of these financial concepts.

**So yes winning in crypto is awesome. But keep in mind that crypto has already armed you with an extremely powerful knowledge. Remind yourselves that this knowledge had been hidden to 99% of the public prior to the advent of crypto. By being so transparent with its monetary policies, crypto has exposed how non-transparent and corrupt the fiat world is.**",CryptoCurrency,"Whether you 'win' from crypto or not, crypto has taught a generation valuable financial skills that neither school nor 9-5 jobs would have managed to.

# Technical:

***How to read the table:***

* The rank represents the times the crypto was mentioned in this sub.
* The values on bearish and bullish columns are the ratio of bullish or bearish comments to how many times the coin was mentioned.
* Reliability index  is percentage of strongest sentiment (except neutral) with respect to all sentiments in the comments and averaged over all the comments. It can also be seen as average sentiment distribution (per comment) for the coin.
* Change 7D (%) is the percentage change in the price of the cryptocurrency in last 7 days.

***Methodology:***

*For Sentiment Analysis:*

* Data collection for sentiments (comments) are performed everyday at 12PM UTC -8:00.
* The comments with less than 6 words are not included in the analysis anymore as many research papers argue them to be low quality sentiments.
* Another filter that is applied that a post or comment should at least have 2 or more upvotes to be included in analysis for this table.
* For this analysis, only one mention of a coin/token per user is considered.
* The sentiment analysis is performed using lexicon model and natural language processing ([nltk](https://www.nltk.org/) module for python).
* Emojis are also considered in sentiment analysis and are demojizied using [Python emoji library](https://github.com/carpedm20/emoji/).

*For WordCloud and n-gram:*

* A word cloud (aka a tag cloud) is **a visual representation of words** in a picture format. These representations are used to highlight popular words based on frequency and relevance.
* An N-gram means a sequence of N words. For example, for 1-gram or unigram, we consider the frequently occurring single words, for 2-gram or bigram, a sequence of two words and similarly a 3-gram or trigram a sequence of 3 words. They are basically a set of co-occurring words within a given text or in this case, this subreddit.
* For the wordcloud and n-gram analysis, all the comments (without any filters) are collected and popular stop words are removed using ([nltk](https://www.nltk.org/) module for python).
* N-gram analysis is performed using  WordNetLemmatizer from nltk module for python.

***Feedback request***:

* Previous posts with ""Fun Fact"" section is renamed to ""Low Cap Radar"". This section will be used to provide weekly updates on some of the low cap cryptos with interesting use cases. OP is no where affiliated to any of these projects.

summerlad86,1635074018,"Okay so I need some help because I don't know where to start.

Im sorry if this question should be posted elsewhere.

&amp;#x200B;

I have lived in Japan for x years. last year I opened an account on Binance.

On Binance Ive got some crypto (not what ppl would consider a lot but still). These were bought using my Japanese bank account and whilst living and working in Japan.

&amp;#x200B;

Now!

I do not want to pay the tax on crypto here since it is insanely high. Ludacris.

If I decide to leave the country, move back home and cut ties with Japan, do Japan still have the right to tax my income that I have made on the crypto? Since historically, most purchases was made whilst living in Japan and through a Japanese bank.

&amp;#x200B;

Im from a nordic country. My country and Japan has a "" double tax "" arrangement. Meaning that I can not be taxed by both countries for my income. This isapplied to salary and stocks. But! since Crypto is still relatively new I have tried to seek answers from someone that has done something similar but has not been able to find anything.

To give an example. In my home country I have stocks. I sold them. Only taxed in my home country.

Since Binance does not have the right to conduct business in Japan, I would assume that this might also be one of the key factors when coming to not wanting to pay tax for it in Japan... perhaps.

paulrudder,1635073746,"I asked for recommendations on here last week for tracking DeFi transactions, and Koinly seemed to be the most highly endorsed. So I figured I'd try it out.

I went to Trust Wallet and clicked on my BSC scan address, then exported my 11 transactions to a CSV file. Then I uploaded that to Koinly and it auto imported everything.

But I have two questions I'm hoping I can get guidance on:

- every transaction shows up as a BNB withdrawal, even though I swapped bnb for alt coins a couple times. Is this accurate? Is every swap shown in BNB because that's the ""root"" coin I used? I guess I was confused why, for example, I cashed out my Baby Doge but I don't see any transactions with baby doge in the title. They all are labeled bnb withdrawals.

- should I include all 11 of my transactions even if some of them were purchases for coins I'm still holding? For example if I include a swap for an altcoin but I haven't sold it yet, would I include the purchase info on this year's tax return or ONLY include it once I do eventually sell the coin? I guess the reason I'm confused is that let's say I decide to hold a coin for 2yrs and then sell it... If I've already included the purchase / cost basis in this year's tax return then wouldn't the cost basis need to be reported again when I sell? So I'd be listing the purchase this year and again two years from now to show what the cost basis was?

Sorry if these are dumb or confusing questions. I know this isn't a tax accountant hangout, but since there are lots of other people who do their crypto taxes here, I thought I may at least get educated replies.

DebateMeLoser,1635071559,"Let me preface by congradulating all the shiba holders for being in profit. Gaining 40% in less than 6 hours is no joke!

Im seeing a lot of disorganization when it comes to explaining the risk behind Shiba especially in the midst of such a rally. I wanted to give some insight into some risks that might have not been considered by some. 

To start I want to reference a video: 
https://youtu.be/r6k7kNr3Q3w

TLDR: The issuing of currency by private banks was a thing around the 1800s closely resembling crypto today. Easy to access capital requirements to open a bank as a business allowed anyone to issue actual curency exchangeable at banks that issued the notes much like a dex. At the peak of the Free Banking era there were roughly 16,000 banks issuing their own notes. The Federal Reserve was created to reign in 'Tiger Banks' who were known for predatory practices. 

So you might be wondering.. what does that have to do with anything? If we have learned anything its that history repeats itself, and we are walking into some shifty waters when it comes to the Ripple court case.

Now dont get me wrong but if that whole case is about disproving that there is an expectation of earnings when purchasing crypto as a contract then thats a tough argument to fight even if were supposedly winning against the SEC. 

https://coinmarketcap.com/crypto-heatmap/

If you look at the categorization of the different coins through cmc youll notice that BTH is called a Store of Value, which when compared does seem like just a currency, with no expectation of returns.

Smart Contracts though? thats rough waters. To say that hodlers of ADA or VET arent 'holding equity of Cardano or VeChain' is a long reach particularily when you look at how they are defined when compared to a traditional security.

Lets bring my points back full circle, because upon a simple glance of Shiba subreddits, to say that there is no exprctation of earnings from shib holders or shib shillers is.. astronomically false.

The institutions that monitor crypto define it best themselves. The cdc heatmap calls shib a memecoin. 

All my points demonstrate that were still remarkably early in cryptos life cycle if compared to history, but its also the wild west of unregulated financial systems, which is great for huge gains but opens up massive risk. 

Shiba and Doge in themselves may be genuine in their beliefs, and managed well enough to not have made the explicit mistake of 'promising gains' that which crosses the line of expectation of earnings, but at its core it is a vehicle to amass wealth, and it is observable by the cesspool of alt cloins that have spawned around shiba.

Im talking coins like Dogebonk, Bone, Dogenomics, BabyShiba, Shibanova, Shiba Floki, Floki Shiba, Minifloki, BabySpaceFloki etc..

These coins have listings on subreddits like 'cryptomoonshots' explicitely promising returns. 

They expose the whole crypto industry and are a massive risk to the credibility of our investments.

I dont want you guys to think im just upset about missing a wave, im sure by this point the experienced investors are used to this type of volatility and everyone has their say to get gains, but the whole category of memecoins is a unignorable vulnerability to the credibility of crypto as a whole and should be discouraged.",CryptoCurrency,The true risk behind Shiba
OkRate9205,1635071352,"SHIB has pumped like a boss tonight reaching a new ATH of over 0.0004!

I ultimately let go of my positions and headed for different coins (atom &amp; matic) and low and behold the outcome was better than I could have hoped for. 

Who's still holding onto a coin that has a good project, but seems dead in the water? The best advice I heard was (to paraphrase) ""in a massive bull market is your coin moving? No? Then it's time to let go.""

Scary_Milk,1635071105,"I‚Äòm not into any TA (technical analysis) stuff, graph interpretation, moon phases or astrology in terms of crypto.

I‚Äòm a classical holder, do my own research when something covers my intention and if I‚Äòm convinced, I invest and just hold. Every coin and token has it‚Äòs time if it‚Äòs a good project and pump and dumps don‚Äôt interest me, I‚Äòm here for the long term values.

But since everything is coupled to Bitcoin in crypto and a dumping BTC takes everything down into the abyss, it‚Äòs good to know when BTC peaks to park your investments into a stablecoin until the market starts to recover to have some extra gains.

The index I follow for that cycle tops, which I discovered at my first BTC dump in 2018 is the pi cycle top indicator. It‚Äòs crazy accurate and predicted every cycle top within three days. And yes, also the last cycles top in april 2021.

I don‚Äôt even understand the tech side, for your interest: It uses the 111 day moving average (111DMA) and a newly created multiple of the 350 day moving average, the 350DMA x 2. When the 111DMA moves up and crosses the 350DMA x 2 we see that it coincides with the price of Bitcoin peaking. 

The name pi comes from 350 / 111 = 3.153, which is very close to Pi = 3.142. 

For me, it worked very good for the past two cycles and I‚Äòm watching it closely. It‚Äôs looking very good right now for BTC by the way and we‚Äòre still at the beginning of this cycle if you believe in Pi.

Do your own research, it‚Äòs just my observation and opinion and I hope it helps someone.

XLMisthebest,1635071061,"In the grand scheme of things I'm still pretty new to the world of crypto. I did a lot of research and decided that I'd play it a bit safe and generally go for long term steady gains.


The one thing I read a lot of was that you need to have a strategy and try to stick to it, I also read a lot of pro DCA comments I'm sure there's people with better strats than mine, but here's what I've been doing.


Step one: DCA in and out with coins that generally trend up over time.


For this, I picked coins in the top 20 or so and invested small amounts into them, slightly increasing my amounts as the price went down. I'd sell off once I was able to make a profit of a few USD buy trading fractions of it as the price started to rise and rinse and repeat. Although the amounts I was getting was relatively small, I would put it to one side and I quickly saw this pot add up.


Step two: Invest profits into long term holding projects.


Whenever I'd catch a coin that I liked and wanted to hold long term going down in value  I would invest the profits from my step one into these. I'd do this every week and just forget about it, basically just DCA in and hold.


So far I have made steady but decent long term profits doing this. I don't make massive gains off anything or really chase moonshots and since the money going into these long term holdings are all raised from profits taken from step one I'm literally investing what I can afford to lose which is nothing out of my salary.

I'm interested to hear what you guys do too.",CryptoCurrency,"My crypto investing strategy, what's yours?"
slushkan3an,1635070975,"I believe, in my opinion, that Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAOs) will not just revolutionize online communities but also create a whole new 'industry', especially when it comes to smart contracts and the subjective human, non-binary elements required to validate or invalidate a smart contract. 

Ok ... that was a mouthful. I am not really good at translating my thoughts to written words but I hope that this example helps: 

Let's look at Person A and Person B. 'A' wants to sell the house and 'B' wants to buy it. Usually, both 'A' and 'B' would have conditions and only if these conditions are met will the deal go through ... this is why we have 3rd party validators and ESCROW. 

'B' asks 'A' to do a some touch-ups and repairs before they buy the house. 'A' accepts but is worried that they do all this work/cost and then 'B' simply decides to pull out of the deal because they found a better one. 'A' asks 'B' to get a 3rd party validator (kind of like a judge that both parties will trust to be fair and objective) and place funds in an ESCROW. Once 'A' completes the repairs/touch-ups, the 3rd party will validate and release the funds in ESCROW from 'B' to 'A'. 

The argument for smart contracts is that they would be able to facilitate this whole thing in a much more efficient (automation), cost-effective (cheaper as there is no middle man fees) and trust-less manner. 

Let's say 'A' did the repairs and touch-ups as requested by 'B' however 'A' used the cheapest materials and labour ... basically just enough to meet the base requirements. Most 3rd party validators will not go way out of their way to validate the quality of the job (good/mediocre/bad) ... their incentive is to make the deal go through as fast as possible so that they get their fees. 

Ok ... so how is all of this related to smart contracts and DAOs?

Problem with smart contracts is that they are binary ... yes or no. Either something is validated or it is not. What about the subjective, human, non-binary elements like quality (which is more of a spectrum)? I think this is where DAOs come in. They would 'ride' on top of smart contracts and would help smart contracts validate non-binary things. For example, there could be a DAO (online community kind of like a subreddit) that specializes in homes/construction/interior design and its community of experts get to vote on subjective matters and get rewarded in crypto for their votes. This feeds the smart contract and the smart contract takes care of the rest. 

TLDR: I think that DAOs will be revolutionize the future of online communities and will be super essential for the adoption of smart contracts, especially for non-binary, subjective human perspectives. 

What do you guys think about this? Really interested to discuss this with you and learn from your inputs :)",CryptoCurrency,What do you guys think of DAOs and the future of online communities?

With the start of the NBA season, we are seeing the first signs of mass adoption of NFT tickets collectibles in the NBA. This week Miami Heat announced that every ticket holder will receive a limited edition NFT of the FTX arena, after the ticket is scanned. When a twitter user called out Mark Cuban that he is suprised Miami Heat beat the Dallas Mavericks to NFT tickets. Cuban responded with a couple of tweets suggestion NFTs for the first Dallas Mavericks home game.

**Benefits of NFT tickets include:**

**Collectible** \- Tickets become tradable digital collectibles (NFTs), with a variety of awesome possibilities for fans &amp; event organizers. (most adoption of NFT tickets is currently happening in this area))

**Increased profitability** \- Total control and insights over the primary &amp; secondary market. Take in the profit that would have gone to scalpers.

**Unrivalled data** \- Clear, verifiable data on ticket ownership, vastly improving marketing efforts.

**Cuban**

Cuban has said the Mavericks were trying to find a good option for turning our tickets into NFTs. He is interested in increasing the revenue from ticket sales and maximizing the experience for fan using NFTs. The possibillity to ask royalties on NFT tickets is a great feature to increase revenue from ticket sales by getting a royality on secondary market sales. Cuban noticed season ticketholders will sell their tickets for a few high demand to pay for their wholse season ticket package. With a royality fee on NFT tickets sold on secondary market sales, the Mavericks will profit aswell from secondary market sales. 

**Adoptiong is already happening** 

major ticketing companies like **Ticketmaster and Seatgeek** are actively working on implementing NFT ticketing. Ticketmaster recently launched a FAQ for its NFT ticket marketplace. Seatgeek hired a blockchain executive as VP of engineering and Seatgeek plans to roll out NFT ticketing for the NFL and NBA. 

Which projects are working on NFT ticketing?

**GET protocol ‚Äì 50m usd (+- rank 600 coingecko)**

**GET protocol** has been working on blockchian ticketing since 2016 and had its ICO in 2017. GET protocol offers existing and new ticketing companies tools to easily implement NFT ticketing. GET protocol has recently crossed the **1 million NFT tickets sold** mark. **9 ticketing companies** are using GET protocols NFT ticketing solution so far. The recently announced YourTicketProvider, which sells 2 million tickets annually. What I really like is that all tickets can be tracked on NFT ticket explorer.

Furthermore, the tokenomics of GET protocol create value for tokenholders. Ticketing companies that use GET protocol for NFT ticketing need to buy GET from the openmarket. The GET tokens that paid for usage of the protocol get transferred to the DAO. Tokenholders decide what happens with the funds of the DAO (burn the token, marketing etc). This proces is currently done manually. Automated on-chain tokenomics is currently in the last test phasing and will likely be announced at the end of the month. A technical overview of the flow of tokens used as fuel for the GET protocol can be read from the link below.

kwadoss,1635068726,"Since 2018 I've been working on the creation of a *Protocol for* ***Open Source Medical research without intellectual property*** *aka the* **Etica Protocol**. [https://www.eticaprotocol.org](https://www.eticaprotocol.org/)

As Victor Hugo puts it so well:  ***""Nothing is More Powerful than an Idea Whose Time has Come""***

I think the time for Etica has come, so let me share a brief presentation of Etica with you.

**Brief presentation:**

Etica aims to promote ***open source medical research without intellectual property***. It incentivizes ***publication of research oriented papers*** (by professionals or not) for each disease added to the network.

Etica protocol has its own currency Etica (*ETI*). The protocol has a fixed inflation of about 2.5% per year. Thanks to this inflation it funds the *curation rewards (for voters)* and *editor rewards (for creators of proposals)*.

It operates based on periods of 7 days. For each period a *curation\_reward* as well as an *editor\_reward* will be issued by the Protocol (respecting the 2.5% yearly inflation rate). For each period all users can submit *Proposals* in order to get a part of the *editor\_reward*  of the period. Etica token holders can submit and vote on proposals  using a staking system (They have to lock Eticas for 28 days in exchange  for ***bosoms***). Bosoms are a unit of measure inherent to the protocol that is used by the voting system. All proposals can be voted upon for ***3 weeks.*** *After the voting duration has been passed the Protocol rewards or penalises participants based on the outcome of the votes.*

The protocol is designed in such a way that **only about 72% of proposals will be accepted**. Thus due to open source competition the creators of proposals will have to **improve the quality of their papers** to get a proposals accepted by the network as things progress

*The  creator of a proposal that was accepted by the network will be rewarded  with a part of the period's editor\_reward that will be proportional to  the amount of Eticas that was used by token holders to vote on the  proposal. If the proposal is rejected, depending on the level of the  rejection the creator of the proposal will have it's stack duration  increased (for instance 65 days) or even lose funds (to submit you have  to put a collateral of 10 ETI that you can lose if proposal is heavily  rejected by the network).*

The  voters that vote on the wining side (can be either accepted or  rejected) will get a part of the curation\_reward proportional to the  amount of Eticas they have used to vote on the proposal. If they vote on  the losing side, their stack will be increased (for instance 84 days  longer) in proportion to the level of rejection.

Full details in the whitepaper.

***The whitepaper:***

chedebarna,1635061573,"Many people will freak out, but I think this is becoming a more popular opinion as figures like Michael Saylor insist on it and spread it.

It is OK to take a bank loan to buy crypto. Under the right circumstances.

First and foremost, as a conditio sine quae non, the loan needs to be repayable even if you lose 100% of the investment. This is akin to the trading advice of not overleveraging. If you have to go without food to pay back your monthly installment, you did it wrong.

I think it's common sense, but we all know about that, so I felt I had to spell it out.

Personally, I took a personal loan that takes less than 10% of my monthly income to pay back. I could have borrowed more, but I just didn't want to. The payback period is 96 months.

This for me is the equivalent of DCAing that amount of less than 10% of my income every month for 8 years, which I think is a treshold used by many people who DCA.

I just used the loan to accelerate this and be able to do a lump sum investment instead to benefit from higher returns from the earlier investment.

The price I pay for that is the loan interest, which at the current rates, compared against the upside of crypto, made it a no brainer.

Now, about what to do once you've accumulated enough profits to pay the loan back in one go and get rid of it... Do not.

Your debt in fiat depreciates every day. And you won't get any discount for paying it off earlier. As a matter of fact, you will usually be penalized.

For example, I am in year 2 of my 8-year loan. I could already pay everything back, principal and interests, with my crypto profits, and be done with that... But early payment incurs a 1% penalty.

Ridiculous, I know. Welcome to modern ""banking""!

Also, why would I want to pay now, when we all know that 1 dollar today is worth easily 1.5 dollars of 2028? Think about the things you could buy with 1000 bucks 8 years ago, and the milleage you get today. And it's just getting worse.

So no, you want to drag ever-depreciating fiat loans for as long as possible in fact -- while accumulating ever-appreciating (at least for the next 10-15 years) crypto.

Now, a similar reasoning works for the previous question that led me to the conclusion that borrowing was the way.

Why DCA in small sums, when you know that in the long run the trend goes up? You want to be a bit careful about the specific moment you throw in the lump sum of course. Try to find a dip. But even if you bought at the peak, if you give it enough time, it's likely that eventually you get a higher return than just DCAing.

Finally, the bit I think will be most controversial, because thisnis Reddit and we're here to play:

If you're young, asset-less, and have a 4 or 5 figure sum to invest (for instance by borrowing it), ignore the ""you should diversify"" crew.

If you have concluded (correctly) that crypto is a good investment that outperforms any other known asset class, why malinvest on purpose? That's not being cautious, but being incompetent.

Diversifying into low or even negative yield assets sounds like the type of eccentricity millionaires can afford, not young working people with no assets who are trying to generate and protect generational wealth starting from 4 or 5 figures.",CryptoCurrency,Taking a loan to buy crypto may be OK
Drstrangelove2014,1635061328," More precisely, **Cryptocurrencies** are **proof that humanity's relationship with money is similar to religion.**

To prove a religion exists, I simply ask the following questions:

* Does the religion have a leader?
* Does the religion have followers?
* Does the religion have beliefs?
* Does the religion have rituals?
* Does the religion have places of worship?

When you put it like this, it is easy to show how basic principles of Bitcoin line up with these five factors.

This is how cryptocurrencies work:

* Bitcoins have no individual as a **leader**. However, a leader does not have to be necessarily an individual, but a function. In this case, the function of ""leader"" is filled by Bitcoin's algorithm, which acts as the ruler that governs the entire currency and network. The result: a robotic leader.
* Following Bitcoin are **miners and holders**. These people actively participate in the religion of Bitcoin and ascribe to the belief that it is a universal currency.
* Bitcoin has core **beliefs**. The main one is that it is a global currency, can't be controlled and is a payment system that is superior to all others.
* Bitcoin has **rituals**. Sending a transaction is a ritual, as is storing your Bitcoins somewhere. Keeping your wallet safe is a ritual. Mining is a ritual.
* Bitcoin has **a place of worship**, which is the exchanges. Exchanges act as a point of contact for people to communicate, trade, and engage with the religion of Bitcoin.

Note that the same thing is true for any other cryptocurrency. It is also the same structure in nations and

In fact, if you have any cryptocurrencies, you are actively participating in a social structure that has a one-to-one correspondence to a religion.

The **most interesting part** about all this?

* *We don't need to convince the world that Bitcoin is a good idea.*
* *We don't need to convert every person in the world to our way of thinking.*
* *We don't need to eliminate cash, or enslave humanity, or fill people with hate and set them against each other.*

Cryptocurrencies are proof that you can have a universal currency without any centralized body controlling it.

***And that's fucking beautiful.***

It's a fascinating example of both the power of groupthink/bandwagoning and how we can intentionally change our culture by creating rituals.

You can reprogram your own mind by simply changing your patterns and creating new ones.

The secret to controlling people is simple: control the flow of information. In this regard, we're winning, badly.

&amp;#x200B;

CoinMarketCap, a price-tracking website for cryptocurrencies, has reportedly fallen victim to a hack that leaked 3.1 million (3,117,548) user email addresses.¬†

The information came into light after the hacked email addresses were found to be traded and sold online on various hacking forums, and [revealed](https://haveibeenpwned.com/PwnedWebsites#CoinMarketCap) by Have I Been Pwned, a website dedicated to tracking hacks and compromised online accounts.

CoinMarketCap, confirmed that the list of leaked user accounts matched its userbase:

 **‚ÄúCoinMarketCap has become aware that batches of data have shown up online purporting to be a list of user accounts. While the data lists we have seen are only email addresses, we have found a correlation with our subscriber base.‚Äù** 

 

While confirming the correlation of the 3.1 million (3,117,548) user email addresses with its userbase on Oct. 12, the company has assured that the hackers did not gain access to any of the account passwords. ‚ÄúWe have not found any evidence of a data leak from our own servers ‚Äî we are actively investigating this issue and will update our subscribers as soon as we have any new information,‚Äù CoinMarketCap spokesperson said.

Despite the confirmation, CoinMarketCap has yet to identify the exact cause of the hack. Responding to Cointelegraph's request for comment, CoinMarketCap [said](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/article/good-security-habits):

&gt;**""As no passwords are included in the data we have seen, we believe that it is most likely sourced from another platform where users may have reused passwords across multiple sites.""**

This makes the fund one of the first pension funds in the world to dare to invest in cryptocurrencies.

The pension fund is said to have invested a total of about $25 million. The fund's chief investment officer, Ajit Singh, thought the choice to invest in these cryptocurrencies was a logical one, he said in an [interview with Bloomberg](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-10-21/houston-pension-buys-crypto-an-asset-we-could-not-ignore):

TLDR:

There can be a perfect oracle network (perfect code, transparency, decentralization) but it is open to something called Sybil attack, where fake data can be profitable. This can be overcome but during that period of time, people will lose trust/traction in this network.

Chainlink solves this by using real-world reputation (banks, companies, etc) to make it a strong network initially and make it a high standard for the future so there's no scamming and therefore can build trust and gain traction from the start.

This post ends with that chainlink will consume all of the trust assurance industry, which I'm not totally sure. Basically everything that has to do with contracts and etc. //my opinion (and I'm not an expert by any means) is that while chainlink will be a big part of this, as it connects the real-world data to crypto world, there has been a lot of advancements since this original post which seems to be from 2019.

Having a strong feeling that the bull run was no where close to being over I was quite sure Shib would have a new ATH in not too long of time. (Spoiler: it did)

I log back on to my favorite subreddit, and shib is in nearly every post. 
""Well that's cool, ima click on one"", I say.

Hello,

So there are some coins that do an ICO and have to deal with SEC and securities and so on.

I see there are coins that launch without an ICO and that makes them not security tokens?

Can someone explain the process and what do you have to deal with in terms of legalities and SEC?

For example, do you need to premine the tokens or not premine? How do you distribute them? How do you get into exchanges? Basically what is the difference from an ICO coin?

WaffleOverlord,1635048629,"If you've been thinking of FOMOing into INX, don't.  The devs (dev??) are the same as InfinitUP, which flatlined a little over a week ago from a rug pull.  If you take a look at the InfinitX CoinGecko listing, and then look up the Smart Contract listed there on BscScan, the marketing fee wallet is the same wallet as the one in the InfinitUP code.

Let's verify this!

Go to the BscScan page for both the InfinitX CG listing (0x1f5d9ffafa57604ae2a43cebadecc175df2f069e) and the InfinitUP CG listing (0xc6f26e6df5f44c0ccd939581987c09b866cdbd1a), and then checking the Smart Contracts for both, which are both listed previously, and available on both CG and CMC.  Go to the Contract address for each one, (INX =0x1F5d9fFAFa57604Ae2A43cebAdEcC175DF2F069e , IUP = 0xc6f26e6df5f44C0Ccd939581987C09b866cDBd1A ).

Now we check the Contract source code.  

Scroll down to where that little green checkbox is, next to the word Contract.  That green checkbox means that the source code shown is verified by BscScan to be the same code in the actual contract.  Now, we use Ctrl+F to find ""marketingFeeReceiver"", and we go to the second result.  Do this for both INX and IUP.  Now compare the marketingFeeReceiver addresses, and copy+paste it (they're the same) into the BscScan search bar.  Look at the drop down menu showing what kind of tokens the wallet is holding.  This wallet has both IUP and INX!!

But wait, there's more!

If we look at the websites for both of these coins, and then scroll down to the Road Map, the Road Maps are virtually identical, with the exception of BNB being changed to XRP.  The dev even misspelled the word ""celebrities"" as ""celibrities"" in both websites. 

I'd very much like to be wrong about this, but the information is all publicly available, due to the Smart Contracts being open source.  I created a burner Discord account and joined the INX Discord server, and pointed all of this out, and the dev MoonP resorted to throwing insults and calling me poor.  At one point, they even said something along the lines of ""I'm a dev and that means I know better than you"", which solidifies my opinion that this is a rug pull.  I made a second burner Discord account, and joined the server, acting as a concerned investor, and was able to get MoonP to admit that the contract addresses I had provided earlier (on the first burner) were correct, from the pinned messages in that Discord server. 

&amp;#x200B;

I don't know if I have to say this, but I would like to stress that XRP and BNB have nothing to do with this aside from the fact that they were pegged to each coin on creation.  Also, this is not financial advice. Do your own research and verify yourself that the information I've provided is accurate.  I refrained from posting links or screenshots, but I will provide them if asked.  Or you can join the Discord server yourself (the link is on InfinitX's CG listing) and scroll up to about 7:20-7:30PM PST or so for the day of October 23 2021.",CryptoCurrency,InfinitX is a rug pull (with proof you can verify yourselves)

# Why is ok to be involved in Crypto:

1. Despite the fact that this is a contentious point of view, many people hold the following belief:
2. Government money is a sin.
3. They believe this because they believe that inflation is a sin.
4. Inflation is the debasement and devaluation of one's currency.
5. And by doing so, the government is essentially stealing a small portion of their own citizens' money every year.
6. Breaking the eighth commandment, ""You shall not steal.""
7. Governments can print any amount of money at any time, devaluing their own people's money at any rate they choose.

As a Christian, if you believe this case to be true, then it is probably a good idea to get involved in the cryptocurrency space.

Last snapshot I decided to fuel my trading addiction by doing a 1 month hodling+staking vs day/swing trading experiment. I started with 100$ because I'm broke af. 

Spent a few days turning that to about 130$

Then I finally thought to check out this Futures trading. I didn't know shit about fuck, so a quick YouTube tutorial and I put in the 30$ I made into it. Shiba was on fire back then and just starting to drop from ATH. 

With 10x Shiba Shorting, and some BTC, ALGO longs, I turned my 30$ to about 250$ in a week! That's about 8 times my investment. 

I came on this sub to brag and got a shitload of warning. The good part was I hadn't been liquidated in that 1 week.

My greed got the best of me and I started trading with bigger amounts(from 250$) and with 20x and 25x
I watched my profits in the position at 100s of $ and like a dumbass I went to sleep thinking I'll be a millionaire in a week this way.

Fast forward to next morning, I opened my eyes and saw 4 messages from Binance. They said my positions had been liquidated üòÇ

Many_Scratch2269,1635044577,"The US debt currently sits at more than 28 Trillion dollars. This is 140% of the US GDP. There is absolutely no way the US can pay this much debt off without devaluating the dollar. The US has already printed more than 50% of its dollar supply in the last 2 years alone. We are already seeing supply shocks happening and inflation rising.

It won't be stopping anytime soon either. The US keeps touching its debt ceiling faster and faster and the debt is rising exponentially. 

https://preview.redd.it/o0bl8z7u8bv71.jpg?width=910&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7f9110b2bca502cfdb3d2ddc7f37801609f4f6f2

Just in case you forgot earlier, in order to pay this debt, the US will have to devaluate the dollar significantly. Guess what happens when the US dollar devaluate? Other countries will also follow. 

**Currencies pegged with the US dollar**: Aruban florin, Bahamian dollar, Bahraini Dinar, Barbadian dollar, Belize dollar, Bermudian dollar, Cayman Islands dollar, Cuban convertible peso, Djiboutian franc, East Caribbean dollar, East Timor centavo coin, Eritrean Nakfa, Hong Kong dollar, Jordanian dinar, Lebanese pound, Netherlands Antillean guilder, Omani rial, Panamian balboa, Qatari riyal, Saudi riyal, United Arab Emirates dirham, Venezuelan bolivar.

The takeaway from this is that Cryptocurrencies are going to be extremely valuable in the future. You probably already know this, but Crypto is going to be more valuable than what you currently think because not only is there significant inflation already, it is only going to get worse as countries have to pay off their debt. 

The US isn't alone in their debt crisis however. Almost every country has to inflate away their debt. The inflation we are seeing currently is nothing considering what might come in the future.

How do you think the world is going to pay all this debt off? Short answer, it can't. Inflation is going to be huge. Crypto is currently the best way to avoid inflation. Crypto literally has deflationary currencies right now while some countries are facing severe inflation. Crypto is one of your only bets to survive the coming inflation. The inflation we are seeing currently is severely underestimated as the CPI doesn't count the housing market and other assets that have ballooned in the last 2 years alone.

TLDR: Countries are going to have to inflate their currencies to pay off their debt (especially after the pandemic, we are already seeing a huge inflation rise) and one of the only ways you can avoid inflation and take advantage of the situation is to invest in Crypto. Invest while you can because inflation will ruin your financial condition in the future if you keep holding your wealth in fiat.",CryptoCurrency,"The US Dollar has to devaluate significantly in order for the US to pay off its debt.

Every time I attach documents, the system writes that photos are blurry, glare detected - I actually tried to attach it 30 times, I took pictures from the 8th iPhone, from Samsung, from different angles, under different light conditions, I even asked another person to take a picture of these documents instead of me (I thought it was from maybe my hands are crooked), the result is the same - blurry! ... idiocy, the system simply does not accept documents and that's it. This identification is not really well tested and instead of simplifying the verification of documents, it's just torturing people who want to register !! Passports always contain glowing security features, and they will always be blurry and make glares!

&amp;#x200B;

3. By some miracle, after completing the ""attach pictures"" exercise, from the attempt number 31, having lost faith in humanity, and also receiving robotic replies in Simplex chat - I proceeded to the window, which stated that photos I have uploaded are on ""manual verification""... This window just hung for another week without any changes. After this week of ""manual verification"" I was simply asked to try again uploading pictures to the buggy system ... Dear Simplex, where is logic?  I even mailed them already by that moment all required documents in high quality - all the same, they send only formal replies and asking you to perform clearly according to the algorithm, like robots ... In a response to my letter, they just repeated me a link, to upload all photos to this moronic system as if I have just registered.

So what do you think? I opened that link and saw a window which stated that ""manual verification"" is being carried out and there were no forms for uploading a photo ... Then there were 2 more iterations of useless correspondence with robots and their formal replies in chat and by mail, in style ""we will fix it now"", ""everything will be ok"" ... and another week of my time has gone...

&amp;#x200B;

4. After some time I again managed to upload all the documents and froze for another week on ""manual verification"". Deja vu... I wrote to them about all this in their chat, they promised to speed it up. As a result, thank you, they ""speeded it up"" ... Another week has passed and I receive a new request:

1. Certificate of criminal record (it takes up to 30 days to receive this paper from the police!)

2. Extract from all bank accounts, where I spent how much and how muck i have earned for 3 months (is this really necessary to open a simple banking account??? What will Simplex do with all my McDonnalds spending checks?)

3. Am I a politically engaged person? (Oh Really? They haven't googled that I am the former president of Russian Federation after a month of registration??)

&amp;#x200B;

Okay, In total, it has already been already 5 weeks since I started my registration in Simplex ... In fact, the account has not yet been opened, I continue sending and sending all new documents ... My requests, to somehow speed up this process, are replied with formal robotic answers that are in fact don't help much.

By today, I have sent an the statement from Sberbank with all my income and spendings for 3 months. Now I am waiting for the readiness of a certificate of no criminal record from the police (I have never ever been asked such document in my life, Simplex is the first company that asked me this shit).

&amp;#x200B;

If you want to lose a month of your life, chat with robots and achieve nothing, then apply for registration in Simplex. I wouldn't recommend Simplex to anyone, it's a terrible service. It would be easier to open an account in the most ordinary bank!

&amp;#x200B;

PS. I will by all means get them to open an account. I need it, because without it, you cannot issue a COTI debit card. Up to now it is 1 month that has passed in vain. I will write on how things are developing!

diwalost,1635035826,"For those who don't have time to read the complete article, here is the TLDR

Here‚Äôs the basic premise. In partnership with data firm The TIE, Cointelegraph Markets Pro has developed the VORTECS Score, ""an algorithmic determination of how bullish or bearish current trading conditions are for a given crypto asset.""

The score is based on historical data, and it considers whole history of a coin or token looking for conditions like trading volume, recent price action, social sentiment, and even the volume of tweets about that asset, that are similar to those it observes right now.

If it finds similarities, it looks at what happened next. Did the asset go up or down? How consistent was that movement? How significant was the rise or fall?

1. Combining all of these data points, it creates the VORTECS‚Ñ¢ Score,  
2. The higher the score, the more bullish the outlook ‚Äî and the more confident the algorithm is and vice versa.
3. A neutral score of 50 means the algorithm sees no significant correlation between current conditions and past price performance.
4. A Buy 80, Sell 12 hours strategy means that the test ‚Äòbuys‚Äô every asset that crosses the 80 score, which is considered strongly bullish. And then it ‚Äòsells‚Äô the asset again after precisely 12 hours.
5. Of course, this is not happening on an exchange ‚Äî it‚Äôs happening on a spreadsheet because it is just a test of concept. 

Why you couldn‚Äôt do this

1. It takes someone two manage the portfolio 24*7 even without sleep.
2.  It doesn't take into account liquidity or order depth on any particular asset on any given exchange. 
3. exchange fees involved.

So why is this a valuable test at all?

A high VORTECS Score has a proven correlation to price appreciation. Not in every instance, not for every asset‚Ä¶ but in general this ten-month trial has made a compelling case.",CryptoCurrency,TLDR - What is VORTECS experiment and score?

when I look at this sub 70-80% of daily posts are shitpost and copied content, rest are shared articles with fortune tellers predicting moving of market and ~5% are actually good posts.

So lets say we didnt have moons in this sub, there wouldn't be that much shitposting or even any. But the question is, would that kill the sub or would it be quality over quantity? I wasnt here before moons so elders please step up and speak about how this sub was before. 
In this state sub is more quantity over quality but it keeps us interacted in some way and so called shitposting let people earn moons. For some People moons might even be a main source of income and that is why they are of great value, literally changing lifes! I agree there is a lot or rather too much copied content and it bothers me.  I would prefer more calm sub with a healty ratio of quality and comedy posts!

I don't know if possible but if this sub could be divided by tabs, one of the tabs would be designated for shitposts/comedy posts and another tab for helpful posts/guides etc. that would greatly help divide those two things in sub while keeping everything in the same sub with possibility to earn moons either for shitposts or quality posts!
This way we could achieve what people of this sub want, be able to avoid low quality/comedy content and only see content they want to see. 


This might be a hot take but I actually think moons improve this sub aside some downsides that come along! We could say we are still early with moons and for me community has to play role in shaping this sub! We need to speak up, and help keep this sub in best shape possible!

So today I was to buy ETH. Saturday is my day for ETH. And when I woke up, the price was somewhere around $3,975. I figure it's reasonable with price fluctuations throughout the day to set a limit buy for $3,950. But then the prices went up. Over 4k it goes and I adjust my limit to $4,000.

Granted, I could've bought at the random non-round number, but the psychology of it wants me to get juuuuuust a little bit better of a price.

Xidorian,1635030040,"Okay so I have immersed myself into crypto, learned a ton, do my own research, take proper security precautions, etc. But now what? I currently mainly use centralized exchanges which are proving to be nearly as corrupt as centralized banking. I want to expand to DeFi and Dexs or whatever but I feel like there is a disconnect in information between absolute beginners (lots of learning material) and the road to being a ""pro"" (also lots of info). (Or more than likely there is just so much information and such a large learning curve that I feel like I'm reaching an intermediate level of understanding but I'm still just a newb)

So I guess my questions are:
- How do I bring money over from my bank and buy crypto relatively safely while not utilizing CEXs and having to fill out KYCs?
- Are ecosystems like Cosmos, Polkadot, Cardano etc. more similar to tcp than browsers? 
   - if so, why can you view them on the internet and not have to use a specific application? Basically how does it all connect together and how do I ""use"" Atom or Polkadot for example?
- also how tf is monero not traceable? Can't they just see what was on your account and do the math? 
- if coins are built on specific blockchains, why aren't wallets and exchanges and dexs more transparent about what chains the coin you hold are on!?! I haven't been able to use a dex yet do to having the wrong typing and even when I bought the correct one I still can't freaking use it.

Nuewim,1635022938,"Market cap is one of most important stats for crypto investors. By knowing current market cap we know how big our profits can be.  By calculating our dream price x number of all coins we can check if market cap will made our dreams ever possible to achieve. 

But there is one problem. It is just numbers. Reality often prove math doesn't work so well as it should. People and markets are unpredictable. 10 years ago Bitcoin having 1 trillion market cap was crazy idea. You would probably end in mental hospital for saying it. In XVI century no would have idea some tulips will be worth as much as a houses. In 2019 no one sane predicted doge can grow so much as it did. Human history if full of impossible things.


Not all existing  coins will possible to  sell. Actually bilions of $  in crypto  were lost forever. For example 21 millions  BTC is just base number. Already thousands of wallets were lost with combined tens or maybe hundreds of thousands of BTC. Satoshi Nakamoto alone have like 1 million BTC. His wallet is inactive for years, we don't even know if he is alive. A lot of other  coins are on lost wallets or destroyed hard discs, owners died etc. Access to them is lost, no one will ever sell them. 

And also a lot of projects burn coins to increase price and reduce number of coins. Market cap is not good measure for coins that have burns. And there are quite a few coins like that, and unlike most people say not only shitcoins burn coins. Best to examples are Ethereum and  BNB also Shiba. Calculating current number of coins with future price or market cap doesn't work for them.

So yes market cap is very important, especially for beginners that dream about impossible things, but after all it is just another stat that can change to certain level especially in long period of time.",CryptoCurrency,"Market cap is very important, but not most important. There is usually less coins that we predict and some coins also have burns."

Never read anything about a commission fee but may have just missed it. How does 25% compare across the other exchanges you can stake with?

silverfire626,1635022573,"I‚Äôve only gotten into crypto since the beginning of the year but this community has helped me out a lot.

I got greedy in March thinking I was a genius, put everything I could in April to only have it crash.

I was afraid in may and June but didn‚Äôt sell. I was trying to round up fiat but even then, I was always wondering if it would go lower.

The fact is none of us can time the market. If you could then you would leverage trade. However, you should always be in a position to come out ahead no matter what it does.

For instance, I wanted to get into matic and thought 1.22 was too high and wanted it to get down some more. I said screw I‚Äôll put in a little bit (now it‚Äôs at 1.60).

I bought Vet when it was a 22c and then it crashed to 7c. I decided to put more in and now it‚Äôs climbing up to 14c+

So long as you don‚Äôt need the money immediately, red days will help with long term wealth accumulation. It‚Äôs much easier to 10-20x when you are buying a crypto at a 50% discount than at an ATH.

Kilv3r,1635021126,"If you were born like me in the last millennium, chances are that you, or someone you know, collected postage stamps.

This was one of the first collectibles I engaged with, long before Magic: The Gathering. I remember the excitement of waiting for the stamps to come off the water-soaked envelopes.

At that time, I was far from being the only one involved in stamp collectibles. Nowadays, this lost some mainstream attractivity.

But that might change thanks to the global adoption of NFTs.

 The Swiss national post launches Switzerland‚Äôs first crypto stamps.
The Swiss national post recently announced that they would launch the first Swiss Crypto stamp (on November 25, 2021). This new of a kind stamp will be composed of a physical and a digital part. The physical stamp will cost 8.90 CHF (approx. 9.71 USD on October 2021) and have a digital crypto image associated with it. 

After purchasing a stamp, people will be able to scan a QR code to reveal the digital counterpart. The digital crypto stamps will have different rarity levels, as it is common in the NFT space.

Swiss crypto stamps facts:

- 13 different designs
- Each NFT is stored on the Polygon Blockchain
- 65,000 copies of the most common digital design and 50 of the rarest
- 175,000 stamps available at launch

This collection of digital stamps shall relaunch the excitement for collecting, exchanging, and trading stamps. Only that this time, people will exchange their stamps on NFT platforms such as OpenSea.

Note that the Swiss crypto stamps are not the first ones to be produced. The neighboring country Austria previously released the very first crypto stamps in 2019.

 Why am I so bullish about this announcement.
Launching these crypto stamps means that a broad audience will have direct exposure to the NFT world. Imagine that now people will be able to buy NFTs from their local post office!

Soon, people will want to know more about NFTs and the cryptocurrency world in general. 

This is a step towards better education and mass adoption of cryptos, and the reason I am so bullish about this news.

2. I don't see a single unique technical thing that this coin has going for it, even the name isn't ""MEME"" enough to make people direct buy into it

Amelie007,1635019187,"The answer is never. When it comes to matters of price it is important to keep a little perspective, and one of the best tools for doing that is to compare the marketcap of one coin to another. 

The crazy but more proper question would be like this: ""What would be the price of SafeMoon if it had the marketcap of Bitcoin"".

https://preview.redd.it/ttkr436v79v71.png?width=774&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7337142e4ac41ae53a879190bb46033a588e8495

So as you can see, even if SafeMoon somehow managed to achieve a marketcap valuation of $1.16 Trillion dollars, SafeMoon would still not even get close to $1 in price. When you look at the circulating supply of Bitcoin being close to 19 million and understand that the circulating supply of SafeMoon is 574 Trillion, that should also tell you why a $1 SafeMoon is an impossibility, as it would have to reach a marketcap that not even all the countries in the world combined have.

**You can go to** [**https://www.marketcapof.com/**](https://www.marketcapof.com/) **and start comparing the marketcap of one coin to another to get a better perspective.**

I'm pretty new to the NFT game and very much learning the ropes with Art, Photography etc. with a view to honing the craft and releasing an NFT collection in future which will also form an integral part of a turn-based blockchain game.

I'd appreciate any feedback regarding this or indeed any of my other NFTs in my collections, especially concerning how they are displayed, and whether the markdown meta data for exclusive content displays as it should.

NFTs are a super exciting emerging market that will eventually become ubiquitous throughout society for birth/land registry, certifications, authenticity declarations etc.

I highly recommend anyone takes a wee bit of time to learn how to mint the most basic NFT as it's a skill that will automatically put you ahead of the curve in pretty much any future industry.

Nervous_Sky_5167,1635017247,"TL;DR: A rant about banks and how ridiculously corrupt financial services are today.   


In the early 2008s, a bunch of wealthy banks decided it was a good idea to sell unbacked, sub-prime mortgages. This was the practice of giving mortgages to individuals that had so bad credit scores/ low income, it was nearly impossible for them to pay it back. To compensate for this 'risk', these *subprime* *mortgages* charged higher interest rates, which were FAR more profitable than the *prime mortgages* they were used to selling. As more and more banks piled on this train and the subprime bubble grew, it only would take a few defaults to set off an explosion. And that it did.

After the US banks bailed out these banks, Goldman Sachs, JP Morgan Chase, Citigroup, just to name a few, were fined **fractions** of their profits. Only 54.4 billion dollars were fined from the largest banks involved, their crimes which had cost the global economy **30 trillion dollars of wealth**. Over 9 million Americans alone lost their jobs, or 6 % of the total workforce, but that wasn't even the worst of it. 

After these banks screwed up subprime mortgages, they used the bail-out money to robot foreclose MOST mortgages, which ended up in one of the worst real-estate dumps, and as a result, 13 trillion dollars worth of homeowner net worth was wiped clean. Robo-foreclosure is the extremely lazy, indiscriminate practice of EVICTING a homeowner and then LIQUIDATING their home to cover the bank's portion of the mortgage, without even considering the mortgage's quality or status. 

**And the crazy part of this all? NOBODY, NOT A SINGLE BANKER WENT TO JAIL FOR THIS.** 

All the youngster's still reading, you think this was bad? Research fractional reserve banking, the practice where banks routinely credit lend your deposited money for interest farming and then pay you a small surplus of what they earn. That's how banks earn most of their money, through lending. And oh my god, does it reak havoc. 

When your deposit of 100$ is blended to another bank at an interest rate, the credit present in the world nearly doubles. Banks are required to secure at least 10% of the original deposit, but the other 90% are lent out, creating 100$ of ghost money in your account, and another 90$ of real money in a loan borrower's account. And this happens successfully, 90$ gets loaned into 81$, and that gets loaned into 73$... Suddenly, an additional 144$ was created out of thin air from your deposit! 

Now when you withdraw your 100$, in a linear world, the 144$ of loan ghost money is suddenly wiped. Now think what would happen if more than just a few people took out their money. Does anyone here still remember the Greece Euro financial crisis? Everyone withdrew their money until all that was left was ghost money. BILLIONS of the inflated economy LOST in seconds. 

And here's just a list of atrocities banks have:

\- The fact that, by policy, your deposited money is not owned by you, but becomes the property of the bank, and that you have ZERO right to that money. 

\- The fact that over 35% of the US dollar's entire existence was printed from February 2020 to 2021. Don't believe me? Look below:

&amp;#x200B;

[A 35&amp;#37; recent rise in TOTAL MONEY SUPPLY \(M2\) of the US dollar. Look at how small of a blimp the 2008 Recession was compared to how bad things are now.](https://preview.redd.it/3evwka6k29v71.png?width=811&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=dd314097651155dfad934098835c05ebe333b2ab)

\- The fact that just like any other 'speculative asset', does the US dollar also have restricted liquidity. You probably wondering, if 35% inflation is backed up in a single year, why isn't everything on fire? Due to low distribution since the Pandemic has lowered spending, money doesn't exchange hands fast enough as of right now to fully distribute 35% inflation.

Hi, i tried getting into margin trading for the first time, just trying to clarify a thing or two.

Could someone please tell me exactly how are the fees/interest calculated on binance? I found this formula on their site: I (interest) = P (borrowed money) \* R (daily interest 0.02%/24) \* T (in hours) , and i saw somewhere that they charge 0,1% (or whatever amount) of the borrowed amount per hour. Does it mean that you're paying both the hourly fees on the amount you borrowed plus the daily interest?

For exemple, with a 1000‚Ç¨ collateral and a X5 leverage in a long, would it mean that i couldn't let it run for too many days, orelse i'd have to pay some stupidly high fees?

Q4 100 reward 20%  = 120
Q1 100 algo reward 20% = 120
Q2 120 algo reward 20% = total 144 algo plus 20(q4)=164
Q3 164 algo reward 20% = 196.8 algo.


But if you add the reward yourself... You can compound right away...

Q4 100algo at 20% = 120
Q1 120 algo at 20% = 144 
Q2 144 algo ( plus the 20% earned q4 = 20) equals 164algos committed) at 20% = 196.8 algo...

By doing what I'm doing I'll double my algo in 3 quarters instead of 4.

OldEntertainment9570,1635010586,"Hey all, something came to my mind recently and i decided to create a hypothetical but kind of probable scenario and open it for discussion.

What happens if the western nations decided to implement some authoritarian measures and confiscate private possessions in order to control the spread of crypto ?

Or if global central banks decided to simultaneously purchase the majority of Cryptocurrencies through obtaining over 70% of the worlds bitcoin in circulation? ( Yes they can do that because they control the money printing machines !)

In my own humble opinion the war on crypto is something that can escalate depending on if the goverments start losing control of their only source of power which is FIAT.

&amp;#x200B;

Since I got into crypto, I've been looking for ways to take advantage of the massive volatility in the market, however every time I've tried to trade on my own I get crushed.  I spent some time looking into algorithmic trading that the big fish do and everything I found was a proprietary paid service.  I'm not much of a coder so writing my own code and integrating an API wasn't a good option for me either.

&amp;#x200B;

Superalgos is a project I found that is so under the radar it honestly took me a while to find it, even when it was exactly what I was looking for.  It's everything I could have dreamed of.

&amp;#x200B;

Seriously guys, this thing has an amazing graphic interface and tutorials that detail how to build or use bots.  The team behind it has been working on it for four years now and are at the point where they've integrated machine learning and AI.  

&amp;#x200B;

I'm not here to shill, it's not a paid service and I'm not a contributor.  I searched this sub and found almost nothing about it, and it deserves more attention.  The entire premise behind it is that the algos evolve within the ecosystem as the community grows and more people contribute.

Centralized storage in simple words is saving all the data that someone has in one place, for example Facebook or any other platform saves all of Its users data in its private servers. Therefore a hacker could focus on Facebook and try to breach it (as it always have already happened) since it's a single point of failure.

After these NFTs entered the open market, they were priced at 5 ETH/each. That's how crazy it was. 0.2 to mint, resold at 5ETH. The people that won the chance to buy one, basically won lottery tickets.

Many people, me included, were incredibly disappointed we didn't even get the chance to buy. But here's the scary part. Many tried to buy from the openmarket at 5 ETH because the FOMO was getting wild.

Many people that bought them at 5 ETH lost a lot of money because now they are being resold for 1.5 ETH. 

1) bought at minting price, I would have made some nice 5 figure profits.

2) If I bought after they entered the open market at peak FOMO, I would have lost 5 figures.

TrafficConeWriter,1635009991,"I was running some numbers out of interest to see what regression models would say about some cryptos I am into. I figured I would share.

A quick statistics background, a regression model is calculated based on the historical data. I pulled 5 years of the crypto's daily high price (note: not all cryptos have 5 years of data). The R-squared value is an evaluation of how accurate the model is. In statistics terms, the R-squared value is defined as ""the amount of variation in the historical data accounted for by the model equation."" In other words, the closer to 1 the R-squared value is, the more accurate the model's projects will be.

As a general reference, typically in projection models, anything about 0.65 is considered pretty good at projecting the future, and anything about 0.90 is considered very reliable.

Here is the summary of the projections for 1 year from today:

&amp;#x200B;

[1 year projections](https://preview.redd.it/6050czcbf8v71.png?width=588&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=376044eb9724eb09c7e882d7ddfd725c1d5e278d)

Based on the data, Solana will have a 744% increase over the next year. The R-squared for this model is 0.8715, which is actually pretty high. However, to assume the value will actually jump 744% would probably be pretty insane based on logic and reason, nevertheless, this model seems very promising.

BTC has a 97% projected increase, and this number I take more significantly. Also take note of the two columns to the far right. The % low means the model is confident in the value being above 62%, but it means it is not very likely the increase will be above 140%.

You can take a look at some of the rest of the values, but most of them seem promising.

BTC, ETH, ADA, SOL, and ALGO are the coins I was really interested in, DOGE I added because, well I don't know I figured people would want to know.

BTC, ETH, ADA, and SOL all had R-squared values above 0.8, so to me I would have some faith in these models. 

Another important thing to note would be that the more data there is, the more accurate the model will be. BTC, ETH, DOGE all actually had 5 years of data, ADA had about 4 years, and SOL and ALGO had around 2 years.

I'll post the actual trends with their trendlines and their equations below. In each case, the top equation is the polynomial value and the bottom value is the linear equation. I never actually did any calculations based on the linear equations because linear equations wouldn't really be a good projection of crypto trends.

On a final note, the disclaimers. This is not financial advice, do your own research, and statistical projections are always going to be risky for financials. I personally will probably use these projects, but in no way to I expect something like 700% increase in any SOL investments.

Lately several central banks in Europe have implemented a negative interest rate policy aka NIRP on excess bank reserves in the financial system. Japan is the next country that will be affected with the NIRP. 

For a country where there are 7 national banks operating and many, many other megabanks and postal banks, residents are estimated to have as much as 8-10 accounts per adult on average. This is mega ultra bullish. Not resident but adult, keep that in mind. 

I used to live in Japan in my youth and people store insane amount of money across several different banks in order to get those sweet returns. And crypto is far from popular there. US and EU is years ahead in terms of adoption compared to Japan where its still almost unheard of to be holding crypto. People think Japan is super ahead of others when it comes to tech but its quite the opposite. Fax machines are still the king of sending the documentation and important data in banks. 

According to the data from Bank Of Japan, there are approximately 920,000,000 reported bank accounts in Japan. Given that there are about 125 million people in Japan and about 13% are children this brings you to about 10 accounts per adult on average. 


According to the latest [Statista report](https://www.statista.com/topics/7629/banking-industry-in-japan/#topicHeader__wrapper) the banks assets in Japan are worth above 18.5 trillion dollars. Coinbase knows that and thats exactly why they decided to go in Japan now. They see this opportunity of a lifetime.

Any exit strategy that I come up with seems premature.  What‚Äôs a 300% win if a 1000% win might require just a little more patience?  When should I sell an asset that keeps rising in value, year by year?

This is where I think it‚Äôs useful to become a bit more existential and death-oriented (the other great exit) in my thinking.  There‚Äôs a useful exercise that some therapists employ, where you draw a line on a piece of paper about 10 inches long.  Imagine this line is how long you‚Äôre going to live. The beginning of the line is your birth, and the end of the line is your death.  Now, mark on that line where you think you might be.  How much life do you have left?   How much time?

Leave your loved ones financial security?  Study vipassana meditation like a monk for a few years?  What‚Äôs the thing that you would do that would endow your life with meaning, that you would be proud of when you‚Äôre reflecting backwards on your death bed?

So here are my rules for casual investors who don‚Äôt want to spend all their free time researching/checking charts and don‚Äôt have $10k to YOLO into projects they like. 

1. HODL. One of the things I learned really quickly is that chasing short term gains, by chasing market volatility, can make you money. However, it‚Äôs a lot of work, hard to get right (read: risky), and really requires an understanding of markets, graphs/charts, trend patterns, etc. As a casual, it‚Äôs much easier, and likely more profitable, to buy things that are likely to grow and just hold them. 

2.  Don‚Äôt panic! The crypto market is super volatile. Which means that things can change in the space of a minute. It also means that things can change back just as quickly. If something goes down, just wait. Unless you bought into something sketchy (see rule 3), it‚Äôll probably go back up eventually. 

3. Buy from reputable exchanges (except Robinhood, fuck Robinhood). If a coin is tradeable on Coinbase, Voyager, etc. it‚Äôs probably not going to FULLY collapse. Obviously there are exceptions to this statement (don‚Äôt @ me), but it‚Äôs a much better bet than some random shit coin you heard about on telegram and traded into on a DEX. 

4. DCA is your friend. If you can, DCA is a great way to mitigate risk. This doesn‚Äôt need any more explanation I don‚Äôt think‚Ä¶

5. Avoid FOMO. If a coin is spiking, you‚Äôre probably too late. There will always be another meme coin/pump and dump you can take advantage of. Don‚Äôt worry if you missed this one. If you FOMO in at ATH and it only goes up another 5%, you aren‚Äôt going to take profits because you‚Äôre chasing the big win. You‚Äôre going to lose value and be stuck waiting for another pump. 

6. Diversify. Don‚Äôt just pick one. Put a little bit into several coins. Most successful strategies I‚Äôve seen have relied on spreading investment around to take advantage of multiple things rising. And, if something goes down, you aren‚Äôt losing as much. 

That‚Äôs it. If anyone has additions or changes they think would be good I‚Äôd love to hear them.",CryptoCurrency,Rules for casuals

So, I'm possibly expecting to receive some form of NFT in the future, and was looking at cold hardware wallets to store them securely. Offline.

I stumbled upon 2 brands that really stick out for me:

Ledger and Trezor (Keepkey also seemed interesting, but I'm worried it isn't as safe).

Anyways,

There's issues with them that are making it difficult to decide which one to get.

Mainly:

Ledger: data leak and tiny screen.
Trezor: can be brute forced.


Anyway, these are some of the main differences I've noticed simply by reading reviews..

Pros:

Ledger: sleek, cheaper, dual-chip.
Trezor: open-source, larger screen, shamir backup.

Things that give me pause:

Ledger: S can only hold 3-4apps?(what does that mean and does it matter to me? I think the NFT will be on Eth).

Trezor: Pricier..  budget is at the moment a concern for me. But if one is definitely safer than the rest, I'll pay up.

jgarcya,1635004846,"I'm poor... An artist, was homeless( couch surfing, but employed).... Had little money to invest due to too much debt....

But that was the past..... Except being poor.

I managed to elimininate a major bill, over 14yrs of paying it....

Here's why I'm rarely in the red.

I was gifted my first $100 in btc in 2018 @ btc= 10,000.... I also used faucets to gather btc, eth, ltc, and bch.

I was lucky to find Bob loukas and his 4 yr cycle of btc, in early 2019.....

Then I was lucky enough to find coinflip ATM... Where I could buy btc,ltc, and eth.

So in March 2019, the start of the 4 yr cycle.... I started taking every extra bit of money, after my bills, and put it in ATM... I was buying pieces of btc for 3800, ltc for less than $40, and eth for under $200...

This was just $20- $100 at a time... No more than $200/mo....

2019 btc ran up really fast.... I wasn't able to keep up.. I had a goal of owning 1btc.... Never happened.

But then, as time went buy, I started buying more and more btc.... When it dipped 10% I went and put $100 on it.... Every dip I could buy I bought.

The crash of March 2020... Btc went from 10k- 3800... I bought every dip... But only small portions...

Then came the run up of 2020...10k- 30k very quickly... I stopped buying btc at $11,500...

In May of 2020, I finally decided to buy some doge...
I found an ATM to get some 3.5 hrs away... Paid an 16% fee, but bought $140 worth at .003... Doge was my long shot.

Still acquired more ltc..... But stopped buying eth( stupid)....

2021 still bought more doge, and bought more eth at $1800...after we saw highs of 3-4k... I bought the dip!.

So here it is current 2021... My last purchase was ALGO... Just to lock it up in governance at 5.7- 32%.

Knowing the 4 yr cycle... I refused to buy btc in 2021, knowing it will retrace 70-80 % in 2022...

I couldn't justify.... Bringing my average up... I average btc at less than 8k...

All of my holdings are in massive gains 300% - 8000%... Except algo( but this is a different play.. Passive income).

So I got to ride out all of 2020 after March in the plus... All of 2021 in the plus...

All of 2022 will be in the plus( even though it will be a down year).... Bc I didn't chase ATH...

In 2023... At the next 4 yr cycle.... I will take saved up fiat, and buy more btc/eth/ltc.... And doge if it drops below .10...

I sleep great at night knowing... I don't have to worry about dips of 30% or 50%... 

I know most here think DCA is the best strategy... Just set a time buy a set amount every 2 wks or month.... And yes it works...

But for me.... I only buy depending on where we are in the 4 yr cycle.... I don't buy the bull run(except wth at 50% off)..... 

I won't buy in the bear of 2022.... I won't try to catch a falling knife.... I'll wait till it hits the ground, then pick it up in 2023...

People say you can't time the market.... That's not necessary... Just know the cycles, and buy the dips... The bigger the dip the better.

I have turned a couple k into 5 digits... And possibly 6 at the end of the bull run....

Never in the red again.

Hope this helps others... Patience and knowing the 4 yr cycle is key...",CryptoCurrency,This is why I'm rarely in the red

2. Start with a small sum that their willing to lose to buy an amount of 3-5 or so different coins.

This was just purely for shits and giggles and I forgot about it a week later I checked the charts of the shitcoin just to see how much it would be down only to find out it had gone on an insane run and I was in profit to the tune of thousands of dollars. 

Of course I took out 40x my investment and let the rest ride as a clown market shit happens insurance. But as I was cashing out in increments as I had enough to completely tank the price.

After researching how criminals use cryptocurrency to evade taxes, and launder money, I decided to see what else criminals use to do illegal things. 

I found that many are using the ocean by placing boats on it to transport drugs, weapons, and stolen goods.     

  If you support using the ocean , you support it's existence, and as long as we keep using the ocean to fish, going on trips, and swim, we are indirectly telling criminals that they have the ability to use the ocean too...  For their illegal activities.  And I'm taking a stand now, and never using the ocean for anything again. 

The fact is, deep in international waters, there isn't much regulation.  There isn't enough eyes on it, and anything can be going on out there.    Especially pirates.  

So one someone tells you they like going in the ocean, remind them of all the illegal things that take place in it.    They should feel bad.     Educate them on the dangers.",CryptoCurrency,"Because of Cryptocurrency, I'm never going to be able to swim in the ocean ever again."

If you are making profit on a coin and want to cash out so you can invest in another always use the convert option. When you sell and invest in another coin there is the fee you will pay. The fee equals losing money, not a lot depending on how much you are cashing out but that fee can go in another coin instead of losing it. When you convert your profit to another coin you get more of that coin than you would selling and buying that coin. 

I've been doing this the whole time since I've been I crypto and it has compounded my money over time. I'm not going to lie, I cashed out once and realized I made a amateur mistake. Only cash out if you need the money

fuzzyduck88,1635002989,"So to start I want to clarify: this is NOT for tax purposes or ANYTHING to do with tax. Also as a matter of FACT this would also NOT be classed as money laundering as one of the proofs for money laundering is that the money was the ‚Äúproceeds of criminal conduct‚Äù. It‚Äôs fully legal to hide any legitimate money. Please don‚Äôt turn it into a conversation about anything illegal. There are strict rules here. 

This came to light from a conversation I was having with a friend about divorce and the the age old myth of losing your keys ‚Äúin a boating accident‚Äù so that you wouldn‚Äôt have to give away half. 

I‚Äôm not getting divorced or anything. This was about a famous person who had recently been divorced and practically lost everything and how he could have avoided it. 

Although there‚Äôs no way of proving the keys weren‚Äôt lost in an accident I don‚Äôt believe this would last in court given the burden of proof in civil cases is only based on probability. If it would be safe to say ‚Äúgiven the facts heard, he probably didn‚Äôt lose the keys‚Äù‚Ä¶then you‚Äôre screwed. 
This is obviously different to a criminal case where it has to be proved beyond reasonable doubt. 

So, back to the beginning. How would one hide their crypto so it‚Äôs impossible for someone with full access to your bank accounts to to determine if you own some or not?(I.e - they can see you deposited money on an exchange). Or is it even possible?

My theory was the best way is to ‚Äúmuddy the waters‚Äù to an extent that it just becomes impossible to determine where the money is. (was it spent, gambled, invested further etc). To do this would mean spending a bit on fees:

(1)Transfer from exchange to a private wallet.
(2) Transfer from wallet to gambling site
(3) Transfer from gambling site to another wallet. 
(4) Transfer from wallet to a new unused hardware wallet such as trezor etc. 
(5) Bury wallet for years.

No_Weather682,1635001213,"**1-** **Thinking that a coin with very low price has greater potential**

I‚Äôve seen too many people saying ‚ÄúIf Bitcoin is at $60.000 it shouldn‚Äôt be very difficult for SHIBA INU to reach $1‚Äù. Nope, that‚Äôs not how it works. You can‚Äôt compare the price of cryptocurrencies by their USD value, because they have different amounts in supply. 

**2-** **Not having a strategic plan**

This is a common mistake made by many beginners that start investing before having a plan. They end up buying too late or selling too early for not having an entrance/exit strategy.

**3-** **Getting Scared of Market Volatility**

You can‚Äôt expect a 10x in your portfolio if you can‚Äôt handle a +20% loss. A lot of newbies get scared of market volatility and end up panic selling. But if you want to stick around you need to understand that cryptocurrencies are very volatile.

**4-** **Falling for Scams**

There are all types of scams (influencers promoting a scam coin, fake emails or fake promotions), but it‚Äôs crucial to recognize them if you don‚Äôt want to lose all your money. Why would a random person double the amount of money you send him? Exactly, never give personal information to nobody. 

**5-** **Being too lazy to DYOR**

Too many people want to get rich in crypto yet are too lazy to do m√≠nimum research.  If you don‚Äôt understand the crypto you‚Äôre investing in and only listen to ‚Äúexperts‚Äù, you will get into big trouble and lose a lot of money.

**6-** **Investing money they can‚Äôt afford to lose**

A lot of beginners throw all their savings or loan funds to crypto without considering that they could lose it. Always remember, don‚Äôt invest what you can‚Äôt afford to lose.

**7-** **FOMO‚Äôing/FUD**

Falling for FOMO or FUD is something that almost everyone fall for when entering the crypto space. It‚Äôs important to not fall for emotions when investing/trading so you don‚Äôt get too greedy and end up losing money.

**8-** **Not diversifying**

You should diversify even when you think you‚Äôve found a sure thing, it simply doesn‚Äôt hurt you to have more variety. On the other hand, when you‚Äôre starting in crypto you should stick to a few crypto with good fundamentals that you clearly understand them.

**9-** **Trading**

If you‚Äôre not a professional, just stick to investing. All you have to do is buy,hodl and DCA, you will not time the market so strop trying to sell at peak prices.

**10-**  **Following trends**

‚ÄúWhat coin is everyone talking about this week? Ok I will buy it‚Äù. Too many people just follow trends, and when their shitcoin trend is starting to lose popularity, they jump into another trend. A good investor often does not get carried away with the trend set by whales or twitter accounts.

NoahsArkJP,1635000170,"Do you think we will one day see a crypto currency that has built in rules similar to what the fed would  use to maximize economic well being? As I see it now, crypto currencies like bitcoin have several advantages over fiat currency- they can't be over printed, there is a fixed supply, and there is no central point of failure. The one disadvantage I see is the inelasticity of a crypto currency with a fixed amount in circulation. Economists regularly argue that a currency should be able to expand to meet the needs of trade. The problem is that when you have a group of people deciding when to expand it and by how much, then human error plays a role (i.e. it can be over printed beyond the legitimate needs of the economy). So why not a crypto currency that has the decentralized advantage combined with the advantages of a currency that can expand as needed?

Glushkov saw the future of soviet economy to be ‚Äúincrementally organized into a cybernetically balanced network of labor, production, and consumption inputs and outputs‚Äù and therefore he saw good reason to ‚Äúvirtualize currency itself and make the exchange of funds take place by ""electronic receipt.""‚Äù He wanted to remove the need for a hard currency and allow all economic exchanges to take place on the OGAS network.

I myself was a newbie without a proper guidance , I invested lot of my money in meme and shit coins with low market cap in expections of huge gains but that didn't happen . Just a few basics Really can change the game for the new folks .

1. DCA in and DCA out - DCA means dollar cost average your money when you enter and when you leave the market , that is investing a previously thought amount of money irrespective the price of the asset. It removes your emotions and fluctuations in the price. And so if you believe in a project and know it's good in the long term , DCA is the best.




2. DYOR or Stay in top 20 ! - research low market cap projects thoroughly or to be safe you can stay in the top 20 crypto which have a good reputation like DOT LINK MATIC ALGO ETH BTC.







3. Stay away from Meme coins - You may gain some profits from them but this will ruin your discipline and Can Be vey bad in the long run ( I have a post about it already you can check it out)

A short backstory. My wife and I invest in stocks and property since about 20 years. Now we have some fresh money to invest and wanted to do it the Smart way. 

Of course I bought some crypto a few months ago but that's just 10% of the money. The rest will be invested into future tech ETF, water and green energy. 

So yesterday was the day to meet our bank manager (he's around 50 I'd say) and we started to talk about this and that. At some point we started to talk about crypto and my wife mentioned that I own some since many years. 
That was the point where this conversation took a turnaround. The bank guy was very interested in crypto and was obviously disappointed that his employer (biggest bank in my country and owner is the state) don't offer any crypto etf to his customers. He asked me a lot of questions like, where to buy without being scammed, where do I see the market in the future, what coins do I own and so on. 

We spend there 4hrs ... Of which 3 was just about crypto! Interesting was he never said one bad word about crypto, but he seemed to be curious about this space.

I'm assuming the answer is yes so here it goes.

sothalone,1634995767,"Been using OKEx for some time, their spot and margin trading is great, no issues encountered so far. Started to use their perpetual trading to leverage my position in order to maximize my profits. 

Firstly, my position was liquidated at a PnL ratio of -55.22% which some may say maybe I have more than one position opened so the cross margin would have wiped me out but no, I only had one position worth 1 BTC opened at that point in time.

Secondly, my trading account had a balance of 571 USDT which u can see from my screenshot. With a sell position of 1 BTC opened at 64,000 USDT and for OKEx to liquidate me at 64,282.7 USDT is simply shocking. Not only should my loss only be -282.73 USDT which shouldn't happen in the first place as my PnL isn't even close to -100% which they claim to liquidate me at, they charged a total of 571.99 USDT to my trading account!

Element_89,1634994902,"Hello all,

I left Australia for Germany in Nov last year and have been a German tax resident since my arrival.

Confused how the double tax treaty works when it comes to my CGT gains (hoping to find guidance here from tax savvy ppl).

My understanding of how I would split my CGT liabilities is below, but hoping someone may have been through this before could verify?

I leave Australia for Germany in Nov 2020:
- I need to pay tax on any Australian gains between the start of the Australian tax year (July 1st 2020) to the date I left (Nov 2020)
-  On top of this, I need to also pay Australian exit tax on any unrealised gains on the date I leave.

Live in Germany from Nov 2020 ‚Äì present
- I need to pay income tax from my arrival date on any short and long term gains. Long term gains are 0%.

Question - I am unclear how my cost basis would be calculated in Germany with a double tax treaty? Considering I will have paid exit tax in Australia, would that mean my German cost basis the same as my Australian exit tax proceeds?

If so, what does this mean for any long term gains discounts in Germany? i.e. if I bring over assets I've held for more than a year, can I still realise a 0% tax in Germany? Or.... because I have paid Australian exit tax - are these assets considered to have been ‚Äòsold‚Äô on the date I left Australia?

Depending on how I calculate this has a huge effect on my tax hit... any help greatly appreciated!",CryptoCurrency,Moved from Australia to Germany to realise crypto gains - how to split tax between countries?

TheRealJanMarsalek,1634994529,"1. **The Dusting Attack**  
This is a scam where you will receive very tiny amounts of crypto, also known as dust, to a lot of addresses. The criminals will watch these wallets that thye've sent the dust to, to see if they can de-anonymize the wallet owner. Once they've identified the owner, they can set up more elegant phishing attempts to sweep the funds from the owner's wallets. Or, they may even physically target the owner to get them to give up the keys. Best way to protect yourself from this would be to leave the dust where it is. Do not touch it, do not interact with it in any way. And most of all, don't bother trying to sell it.
2. **The Clipboard Malware**  
This one is where your device has been infected with a malware that changes the address that you have copied and pasted from your clipboard. The malware can swap the addresses to the hacker's own address, or to a random string of characters. When that transaction goes through, you'd have lost that crypto to the hacker or just poof, thin air. To avoid this scam, make sure that your device is clean, and not infected with any kind of virus. Keep your antivirus software up to date. When you copy and paste your addresses, double, no triple check to make sure you're sending it to the right address.
3. **The Hot Lady in Your DM**  
Gentlemen, this scam is the one that targets your primal brain. A very attractive woman often dressed scantily with big boobs (sorry) may show up in your DMs asking you about crypto and try to chat you up. This eventually leads to ""her"" manipulating you into giving up your 12 word phrases or passwords. They may try to initiate exchange of nudes for crypto. They may even have a sob story and make you feel bad into sending her crypto. Best way to not fall for this, is to always remember that ""if a hot lady DMs you about crypto, ignore him"". Another variation of this is the ""send me crypto I'll double it for you."" or the ""Investor"" who thinks you're so special and wants to help you. There is no free lunch in this world. Nobody here is looking out for others by giving you free crypto (except moons of course). Personally, I avoid talking to anyone via DMs on here.
4. **The ""Helpful"" Support Team in Your DM**  
This one is where a support team ""member"" from the project DMs you via Telegram or reddit to help you validate your wallet. This is an attempt to get you to divulge your private keys, or they'll link you to a phishing site that looks legit to get you to key in your 12 word phrase. It is very common to get some attention from scammers in your DMs when you've just posted a question on a subreddit or telegram group. To protect yourself, remember not to entertain any kind of DMs from anyone. Do not click on any links, and most importantly do not give anyone your private keys.
5. **The Rugpull**  
Rugpulls happen all the time, and even billionaires have fallen victim to them. This is a scam where the developers of the smart contract, or the project drain the funds from the liquidity pool. This is especially common in De-Fi, and have been on the rise as well. The best way to not fall victim to it, is to make sure you invest in projects that have fully doxxed and trusted developers &amp; have trusted smart contracts. Of course, not everyone's gonna go through the code to make sure that the code is clean. There are third party companies that do contract auditing, such as Certik. This is where DYOR comes in. Personally I would avoid Binance Smart Chain projects altogether, cuz that's where i've experienced many rugpulls.
6. **The Honeypot**  
This is a very common scam that I've experienced quite a few times in Binance Smart Chain ""projects"". The scam is very simple. The contract is written in a way where you can buy the token, but selling will be impossible. So if you're watching the charts, and you've thrown money in there, you'll see the value rising. However, when you're ready to sell, you'll notice that you won't be able to. The best way to avoid such a scam is just to watch the transactions on BSCscanner, to make sure that buy and sell transactions are going through to unique addresses.
7. **The Attack of the Clones**  
Another kind of phishing attack, where you might get an seemingly legit looking email from an exchange, with a link contained within the email, or clicking on links from untrusted sources. These links may lead to websites that look like the carbon copy of the original website. There might be a security notification telling you to key in your seed phrase. When you do key it in, the hackers will own your crypto, and can simply sweep your wallet clean. To avoid this, you should double check the url of the site you're using, as they often look dodgy, with a .org or a .net extension. For instance you may click on a link that takes you to ""pomhub.com"" instead of the actual site. To protect yourself, bookmark the actual links to the exchanges, instead of clicking random links.
8. **Pump and Dump**  
There are many telegram groups that organize planned pumps and dumps, hoping that others will FOMO in and buy in. Once the price has pumped, the people who are in on it will dump their positions, causing significant loss to the ones who had FOMO'd in. Often times, the owners of the project may be in on it, and may even pay influencers to shill the project. When the coin has pumped enough, they will just dump their positions and pocket the profits. To avoid this, just don't FOMO into projects. Don't listen to some influencer with 1 hit song back in 2013 to make financial decisions.

A man in France is under arrest because he was hiding assets in cryptocurrency from the fiscal authorities. 

After a speed ticket was given to him for riding too fast with a Lambo, police launched an investigation and it appeared that the individual's lifestyle didn't match the declared revenus/assets. 

His explanation is that the speed at which he was gaining those assets didn't give him enough time to declare the gains to the authorities and also the lack of knowledge on how to declare them has prevented him from doing so too. Obviously, the judge didn't buy the excuse, thus a fraud investigation was launched.

At the 1 bedroom appartment of this man, they found the following items;

- 10 gold ingots (1kg/ingot)
- 250 pure gold and silver coins (value ~500k‚Ç¨)
- 1.5M‚Ç¨ in crypto assets in his cold wallets on the computer.

It is also discovered that he made several trips abroad to sell the gold and silver he had in his possession. It is the way he chose to convert crypto to fiat. Thus adding a money laundering charge into the case.

This happened this week, no updates have been done in regards to this matter as investigation is still ongoing.

Everyone needs to read this, stay safe out there it is a dangerous place to be if you haven't put the research work in.

If you are in this group and you are a begginer I really want you to consider this when you are investing. 

I don‚Äôt consider myself a skilled developer and in fact I know very little, to nothing, about coding. When it come to being technical, I'm the guy who refers you to my buddy lol.

Now, I've been trying to dig more into the tech behind crypto and found a lot of things  confusing, but, all technology aside, I was curious as to what creating and launching a coin really ment.

Fact is, after 1 google search and 20 minutes, I could transfer $100 to a ETH wallet and create a coin with a 50 million supply with a few clicks and copy and paste.

The entire thing took less than an hour.

Let‚Äôs say today I created a coin with a 50 trillion supply and sent 25 trillion to someone else. 

Now I really want everyone to think about the fact that a person with no real technical understanding could create a coin in under an hour. I'm sure everyone in this group probably could too after watching a few tutorial. 

For an extra $50 I could put up a website and another 10k on a copywriter, I could easily launch an ico and sell a shit ton of these useless tokens promising things that don't even exist.

Its actually pretty easy to get listed on exchanged and coin market cap if you create enough hype and trading volume around your coin as well. Just meet their criteria and apply.

This is what 90% of the stuff in crypto is, nothing more than a coin that took 20 minutes to make and $100. I want everyone new in this group to realize that 99% of the promises that cryptocurrency and blockchain projects have are in things that do not exist and tech that hasn't even been developed yet.

This is why all this is so exciting but also so scary.

Before you invest in a coin do you ask who are the developers on a project? What funding do they have? Do they even have a working platform? If not, What's the application they are working for and what are their benchmarks? Is the coin actually used to power the tech or is it just a ""coin"" that has no real function?

The reason why people spend hours really digging into these coins and the projects behind them is because it's extremely important to understand the REAL risk.

Anyone can create a coin in 1 hour put up a website in an a day, and have a ico promising pipe dreams ready to launch in a week, in a world with no rules or regulations. 

There are just over 13000 different crypto currency‚Äôs,(based on Coinmarketcap) how many of these do you think offer actual use cases? How many do you think are a scam? My guess is probably about 90%

CyberPunkMetalHead,1634992264,"I recently shared a new project that I've been working on for the past couple of months, and man did it blow up on Reddit! You can read more about it in my post [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/qc9zoe/finally_did_it_i_made_a_crypto_trading_bot_that/). 

In a nutshell I created a crypto trading algorithm that can scans the Binance announcement page, and when Binance announces that they will  be listing a new coin, the bot will automatically place a buy order on Gate. io. 

I've observed that coins shoot  up when Binance announces that they will list them, and people rush to buy it on other exchanges in anticipation of the listing - creating a snowball effect. The crypto trading bot aims to take advantage of that and ride this spike that can sometimes reach 10x.

Manually trading it would be impossible, so a tool is needed to act quickly.

So many of you got involved with the project that we now have a growing community of 750 programmers and crypto enthusiasts all working to improve the original tool!

Here's how the bot works and why it works like this: [https://youtu.be/SsSgD0v16Kg](https://youtu.be/SsSgD0v16Kg)

It's free to use and install but it does require a bit of technical know-how.

I gave them an overview of what it was about and how I believed that it was going to change the way we thought about money , finances and savings. I said that if they were genuinely interested I would show them how to get started, join an exchange, how to place an order, DCA etc.and a few cryptos to get started with. They were really keen, but the wife wanted to get the opinion of her brother first, an accountant. Of course his advice was predictable...don't touch it, it's a Ponzi, scam, rat poison etc. So she didn't want to go ahead anymore. About a week later the husband came to me and said he was still keen and had a little money put aside for his daughter ( they both had adult children from previous marriages).
I introduced him into the crypto world and he has done substantially well, like, really well ...four figures was now six. We would chat about Crypto when we would catch up, but asked me not to talk about it in front of his wife, which I thought was  a bit weird. Anyway his wife noticed him spending a lot more time on the computer and happened to see one of his balances on a wallet and hit the roof, but then asked about her share of the proceeds?!. He of course said well the money is not mine , it's my daughter's and by the way, you didn't want to get involved.

Klaasiker,1634990973,"Let's turn the time back to 2017.

Crypto wasn't really my thing but I started to gain information and was really curious about the world of Crypto. So back at my workplace a colleague came up to me and told me about that really interesting and safe company located in Mexico called Masbitcoin.

As I didn't knew much of it I went on Google and searched to find stuff about them. And Oh boy did I miss those Red Flags. They had a system where you get 60% of your investment every 60 days. So if you invest $500 you get $300 bucks every 60 days. If you recruit others into the ""company"" you'd get your money earlier than after 60 days. If you invest more you'd obviously get bigger gains.

To be honest: I was curious. So the Work-Colleague did set up a profile for me. In the meanwhile I bought my first ever Crypto and ""prepared"" myself to invest about $2000 into Masbitcoin. But in the end something in my head said: go for the smallest investment and I listened to myself and ""only"" invested $250 into Masbitcoin. All the other coworkers took way way bigger investments like $2000. 

So after investing I saw in the pyramid that my Co-Worker placed me above all other Co-Workers. Per Person which gets placed beneath you you'll get the money 3 days earlier so after 45 days I really got 60% percent of my investment back ($150). Now all the other Co-Workers realized that this ""works"" and started to invest even more. 

Skip forward 60 days. I should get my next payment by now. I never wanted to ask others to invest as I don't like to give financial advice to others. And oh wonder: We all didn't get paid.

The homepage was down. All numbers were blocked and you had no way to get into connection with Masbitcoin.

I learned my lesson with a loss of $100. Luckily the BTC prize increased and the amount of BTC I still had in my wallet easily covered my loss.

My Co-Workers lost it all as they didn't own Crypto next to their investment into Masbitcoin.

This was the last thing I ever heard about Masbitcoin: [https://bitcoinexchangeguide.com/masbitcoin-ceo-jorge-sanchezs-bodyguards-gunned-down-in-mexico/](https://bitcoinexchangeguide.com/masbitcoin-ceo-jorge-sanchezs-bodyguards-gunned-down-in-mexico/)

The reason is that you're using borrowed money to trade with someone else's money, in this case the exchanges money, and you're taking on increased risk in order to use that money. For example, if the market moves 10% in your favor, you make 10x gains using 10x leverage, but if the market moves 10% in the opposite direction, you make 10x losses.

At long last, Kraken have enabled staking for Algorand (ALGO) @ a pretty tasty 4.75% annually.

Nothing better than knowing your crypto is just sitting there accumulating more crypto while you sleep. This is the way!

It's a bit confusing though... I hadn't staked my ALGO and just noticed that I got Staking Rewards yesterday despite my not having done anything, and my bag not showing as Staked. Maybe this is because merely holding ALGO is the official wallet does the same thing? At any rate, it seems to behave the same on exchange with Kraken. You can still go and manually stake it too (though not sure what difference this makes).

Now I need to buy more ALGO to boost staking rewards earnings... ü§®ü§ë",CryptoCurrency,ALGO staking live on Kraken @ 4.75%
Flashy-Strike-873,1634985762,"I wonder how I can get into low market cap coins that are not on exchanges, yet, without triggering taxable events everytime I do it.

For example I would like to accumulate some CKB or eXRD but to do so I need to get ETh first in order to swap on uniswap etc.
The thing is that whenever I use Eth it is considered a taxable event in my country therefore I am looking for other ways to buy small caps. 

Of course I could buy more ETH via coinbase and then send it to my wallet for swapping on a DEX. 
But due to the first in first out rule my ‚Äûolder‚Äú ETH in my wallet, which has gained profit since I acquired it, would be regarded as ‚Äûsold with profit‚Äú if I use it for a swap to another coin. 

Maybe some of you can share their experience or have some tips for a workaround.

BerthjeTTV,1634984822,"Hi guys

Just a reminder for people who doesn¬¥t know that there is a faucet out here for MOONs! What is this? A faucet is a drain for any currency. You earn little amounts of it by just using it every **24 hours**.

**How does it work?**

You just copy your vault adress and paste it in the input field. Then you¬¥ll get a random amount of MOONs (depends on the amount that is available). Do not do this multiple times a day, you can only do this every 24 hours. You may say it is a ¬¥small¬¥ amount but it gets around 0.04-0.07 for me so it adds up! Its also free and there is no catch :) this is good to be true but it is true :) enjoy!!",CryptoCurrency,Know There Is A Moon Faucet!

Anyone have an opinion on Jamsy(good or bad). Seems like the IOT is the future and is not looked on in the same way as other use cases. 

At the moment it's trending @ 6c per token from an ATH of $4/5. Does it have the potential to recover some of this?

Am I leading myself into a rug pull?
